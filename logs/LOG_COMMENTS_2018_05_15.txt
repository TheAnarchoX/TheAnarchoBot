Seems like you've answered your own question. You said someone could be really good and not win any fights. This is true. So when someone says someone is a good wrestler they just mean in terms of their performance, not the end results.

So things like promos, ability to tell a story in ring, moveset(acrobatics and other things), ability to get the crowd believing/reacting, so on. posted to submission: CM Punk understands critics of UFC 225 PPV spot: 'If it was up to me, I'd be first fight on Fight Pass'

[19:58:04] Comment: dz0zy9s by gr00grams : > The "problem" is that allelopathy provides an entry level skill for clearing content in the game. It can clear all the content, as many entry-level things can do, but it can't go any further due to its restrictions of being a 5L.

This is the crux.

It's not 'entry level' if it gets you to the *end*. It's not a 5L, it's a 6L.

What do you get for a 20% Blight? 10% AoE... what do these gloves have on them? 10% AoE.

It increases the hinder duration, and also adds 20-30% damage over time, as well **you** cannot be hindered, which is actually super useful from the act 5/10 mob types.

If anything, it's almost like a 7-8 link, counting its extra mods. 

> For the casual players who only play maybe 40 hours throughout a league and only get 1-3 ex, then allelopathy serves just fine for their pure blight builds.

This is the overwhelming majority. That's why it's an issue.

In short, the gloves are *very good*. To the point that the gem doesn't see use. So adding the Vaal version to the gem only is enticing, it's not going to see a lot of use because of the gloves.

This can be compounded when little Billy tries to install something that does turn out to malicious, but "Bobby over there installs things too!" so it shouldn't be a problem. 

Then there is the fact that even tech literate people might go on autopilot and accidentally click on a link to install from a non official source. This happened to my (now wife) a few years ago when we were trying to watch a DVD on a fresh install of windows and she tried to download VLC. She realized during the install that she was stupid and wasn't paying attention, and I just had to reinstall Win7 again, but you can see why you don't want this happening in schools.

Of course in the context of this story, just have a fucking adult conversation with the high school aged kid why you don't want him to do it (*you* might understand what is and isn't malware, but many of your classmates don't) and don't actually punish him for it.

I was maybe three years removed from actively watching any television whatsoever, but because the Common Room was a frequent hang out place in the house I was an RA for I had seen some commercials hyping an upcoming episode that night.  So I decided to give it a shot.

That night was the debut airing of 18th and Potomoc.  I was floored that after only having watched these characters for 43 minutes or so that I could be made to feel such loss by the episode's end, and I was hooked after that.

The following year Bravo started showing it every day at 5 and 6:00, and that was when I got my girlfriend (now wife) hooked on it as well.  Didn't take too much effort. posted to submission: What made you start watching The West Wing?

This gets at something much deeper. Trump dominates US politics by shoving himself into the headlines, intentionally as well as inadvertently. Everyone who sees something wrong with him can agree that he's doing things wrong. But there's no room in the headlines for rivals to explain what would be right, and there's no real alternative way for a consensus to emerge. It's been true to a lesser extent for every previous president in the modern era. The leader sets the agenda. Everyone else reacts to it.

Common sense says Trump's behavior should create easy alliances between everyone who prefers functional government. But there's not enough awareness of the shared middle ground. Differences get attention. Shared principles get overlooked. People lose sight of what they are looking for. posted to submission: I'm Timothy Snyder, author of "Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America," where I explain how post-truth is pre-fascism and how the Russian present could be the American future.

>(he never guilt tripped her or anything)true, because she played smart and never gave him opportunity to do so

>(Futoshi, I don't want to pilot with you. I'm sorry but that's just how I feel)well she volunteered to switch out and actually did say "sorry", her actions says exactly what you asking
>(victim in all of this) i never said that or implied that, it's opposite in fact Kokoro is driving force behind whole sequence, **she is aggressor** and if Futoshi will try his luck with "explanations" or try to change her mind he will become an obstacle, obstacle that must be destroyed by any means possible&nbsp;

now to major things he done wrong

first one is forced promise, in their situation (middle of mission, piloting in pair, no clear possibility for switch in sight) she has no good way out, none

she can't deflect or deny this promise without danger of blowing-up their connectivity and risk killing both of them right there

i **do not** say he done it on purpose but it happened anyway&nbsp;

second is right after shuffle announcement when he said "we don't need this shuffle" right there at this very moment you could read on her face&nbsp;

I wear both of those in an 8.5 but I tried a Chelsea last year in 8.5 and when I stepped you could see my foot spilling over both sides of the boot and they were not comfortable at all. I‚Äôve also found that I prefer my boots to be a little long initially, as after I wear them and they start to ‚Äúcurl‚Äù for a lack of a better word - they fit much more comfortably than if they felt perfect or slightly short out of the box.

How you go about that is up to you.

[20:01:33] Comment: dz104ro by TeaAndDevils : They really don't. And sadly, most of my current experience is with Druid, Revenant \(in a support capacity\) and Chronomancer because despite being able to link away at those [95th ](https://www.gw2raidar.com/encounter/CriedRecruitmentAcceptedStayMine)[to ](https://www.gw2raidar.com/encounter/LanguagesIndirectlyMassiveOrganizingSqueezed)[100th](https://www.gw2raidar.com/encounter/LodgedGrandestIdeologicalOneReproductions) [percentile](https://www.gw2raidar.com/encounter/AbandonsPhysicalFruitCmAgony) logs \- normally achieved in pugs or when other people want to play support or training runs that will accept an experienced DPS of *any* profession \- my groups haven't preferred me to bring support.

I understand. I don't fully accept it and I am stubborn and try to rationalise why I am worthwhile on my thief but I fully understand why they don't want me to.

It is because, seemingly, Anet don't want people playing Thief in PvE \- they could have taken any opportunity to buff us fairly with what we bring \(not much aside from DPS\) in mind. We could have received small buffs like the majority of professions when raid\-wipe buffs like Spirits and GotL were nerfed. They could have bothered with a tested rework of Deadeye. They could rework our rotations to involve procs, weaponswaps or interaction with Malice. At this point Anet have actively chosen not to and it really feels like they don't want Thief to be a viable instanced PvE profession.

So yeah, I'll fully agree. It is infuriating.  posted to submission: A Week Later: Why Are We Not Still Talking About How Awful The Deadeye Re-Work Turned Out?

In my Dynasty draft that year ('15) I picked him with the 3.01 and I got verbally abused for grabbing a guy I had to sit on with that high of pick (in an 18 round expansion draft).

[20:01:50] Comment: dz104rt by kayuotter : Hey! I saw your deck, it seemed sweet and made me want to revive this list as I had the idea and played in some local real life events with it a year or so ago.

I have moved to 2 bridge and cut the damping sphere from the main, there are some sideboard tweaks but the main other difference is replacing seachrome for glimmervoid to better facilitate the splash colors and cutting the plains for a third island as it was too often a terrible draw. Oh and I also went for a 2 path 2 dispatch split to increase consistency of having an early game removal spell and to hedge against meddling mage.

I'm still on 4 relic 4 inspector, they basically are there to have more 1 drop artifacts as you say, but the fact that they can replace themselves and that in some matchups they are both 'worth' more than a card means I have been very pleased with both so far. Inspector gains life against burn and humans and sometimes even blocks or double blocks to kill off an attacker. Burn is already a good match up for my list so I don't know if the life-gain from battle is needed but the card is certainly sweet. posted to submission: Competitive Modern Constructed League, May 15, 2018

The way she loves you may be the best that she can do but it will never be enough for you. She does not have the right to change the rules to suit only herself 9 months into a commitment. There's real feelings and a child involved and you did not sign up for this. 

I understand why you're defending her and making excuses for her behavior, but she doesn't deserve you or the life that she's flaking out on. 

It you're not careful, this will destroy you. Your child needs one of you to be the responsible adult and it sounds like it's going to have to be you. Stop putting you and childs future into the hands of someone who is willing to throw you away.

[20:02:51] Comment: dz104sf by Caelinus : There are multiple cases and investigations into Trump. The Clifford case is about to corruption, finance violations abd intimidation. The SDNY case is about financial crimes of some sort, not nessicarily relating to Russia. Meuller's investigation is about links to the Trump campaign and Russia.

They may all link p in some areas, but that does not mean they are the same think. Clifford is not working with Meuller, they are on two entirely different tracks, and it is not her or her representation's goal to prove collusion.

What you just attempted to do was throw a bunch of rhetorical tricks in a row to confuse the issue. 

First: They are not trying to prove collusion, and so discrediting them by saying they have not is ludicrous.

Second: Since the case has nothing to do with Russia, accusing her of being a Russian agent and calling it logic is top grade double speak. Nor does it even hold a narrative: What possible reason could Russia have to discredit someone who is remarkably pro-russia? 

Third: She could be a horrible person in her personal life, and could be in any cult she wanted, but that would be entirely immaterial to this case. If what she claims is true, then the President and his campaign have broken the law. If I go out an murder a member of a cult, saying they were a bad person is not a valid defense. Further, on this note it is obvious that you are attempting to just throw as much as you can in the hope that something will stick.

Fourth: He won't be disbarred. If you have a single legal reason to think this is possible then you should probably advise Trump's legal team, as they certainly don't. He is doing his job by representing his client to the utmost, which is his legal obligation. Further, he has had significant success in court up to this point. 

Fifth: The rule of law is not communism. It is all that defends us from tyranny. This is again top-grade double speak. There is literally nothing in this situation or in these legal actions that have anything to do with a political philosophy. In an actual communist country there would be no legal action as Clifford would have either been inprisoned without due process or dissapeared. She is on the side fighting against the tyranny of an oligarch. Accusing her of being communist for pursuing her legal rights under US law is bizarre. posted to submission: Michael Avenatti To Critics: Accept The 'Huge Amount Of Success That We've Had‚Äô In Stormy Daniels Case

Yes E-Tron is still "viable", just no longer fotm so less people are playing it. ALSO, people know how to play against E-Tron which has more to do with it's success than "x deck" being any better.

[20:04:36] Comment: dz10c14 by kenlane : It's sort of up for grabs I think. One thing I've heard about Latvia is that this is the best team they have sported in some years. The team is also very young (broadcast guys were talking about this the past few days) with many of them being under 25 or even just 20-21. I was super impressed by their play against Canada.

Denmark has a lot of talent as well but I just don't know. They seem to be able to get it done in games that are expected to be close and definitely played better than the score against the US.

[20:04:40] Comment: dz10c18 by chcampb : > all people in jail were convicted of a crime (whether they're innocent or not has no relevance)

Well for one, it does matter. We have seen increased conviction rates for POC, and also, judges have literally gone to jail for pushing kids through the system for kickbacks. You can't say it has no relevance when 

Second, if someone does something illegal, you need to create a deterrent. That much is clear. What isn't clear is if the societal cost of the deterrent is worth preventing the action. If you take marijuana for example, is the societal cost of jailing someone for possession better than the cost of just... letting that person do whatever? Does it have enough impact on people to justify spending money to lock that person up? And if so, why not for alcohol and tobacco?

Finally, in the same vein, the war on drugs was, by the admission of the architect, created to weaken minority and liberal communities. Why do we accept that people who do something illegal, which was made illegal specifically for the purpose of weakening them on the basis of demographics, is fundamentally wrong? That's the argument you are making; doing something illegal is wrong. That's not always the case. It's illegal in some middle eastern countries for a woman to drive a car. Is it wrong for them to insist on driving? Of course not. You have to evaluate the actual societal cost of things.  posted to submission: This New Bill In Congress Would Imprison People For 10 Years If They Injure A Cop

[20:05:14] Comment: dz10c1s by BionicPotato : "good" and "bad" are all relative to the morality and value set of the person reacting. Whether or not someone's actions are good or bad rest very much on who is reacting.

For example, voting down increased gun restrictions: many people would love this and consider it a good thing. But many people would consider this doing wrong against our country.

Just because someone perceives actions a different way based on different values doesn't make them "living in fantasy land" any more than you are. Important to respect your fellow human beings and Americans.

[20:06:20] Comment: dz10i0s by rabbitlion : There is no direct ferry from Str√∂mkajen to Sandhamn. If you absolutely want to start at Str√∂mkajen, you have to take 2 separate boats, for example [this trip](https://waxholmsbolaget.se/v-trip-search/\(results:search\)?departureSiteId=301&destinationSiteId=125&date=2018-05-16&returnDate=2018-05-15&returnTrip=false). However, this takes around 8 hours including a 3.5 hour stop where you switch boats. The normal way to do it is to take the bus from Stockholm (Slussen) to Stavsn√§s and then take the boat from there to Sandhamn. This takes around 2 hours. You can find the timetable here: https://waxholmsbolaget.se/globalassets/tidtabeller/sodra-skargarden/var/16a-var2018.pdf

For example, at stations like Pape, Bathurst, Finch and Dundas West, the bus depot is located within the paid area. You do not need to tap again.


For other stations like Queen, Jane, and right now - Main station, the buses load outside the fare paid area. You would have to tap to enter the bus, and Presto acts like a transfer allowing you to take the bus with the same fare.

[20:07:12] Comment: dz10i1r by HazelGhost : > In my language he/she is just the tip of the iceberg. EVERY noun and adjective is gendered. And there are NO gender-neutral pronouns at all.

Yes, I speak some German and understand how deeply ingrained this is in some languages. However, it's important to point out that in these gendered languages, pronouns are nouns are divided by gender, not sex. When I describe a mirror in German as "der Spiegel", I am not saying that the mirror produces gametes of a particular kind.

This is why specifying the pronouns in English as distinctly sexed (and not gendered) is actually a fairly unique approach, when compared to these other languages.  posted to submission: GC folk: do you support "he/she" as strictly sexual pronouns?

[20:07:15] Comment: dz10i1u by katiecharm : Last year a video of MGM staff refusing me entry into the women's bathroom went pretty viral (fucking Milo reposted it and it got millions of views).  Bunch of hate sites picked up on it, and still talk shit to this day. 
 
Turns out MGM super broke the law, and they came down with Thor's Axe on everyone with all new training.  All the execs wined and dined me and the CEO called me to thank me for not suing them and making an even bigger fuss about it. 
 
I passed a lot less back then and was a lot less cute, but I'm glad it happened.  It set an important precedent and got a needed issue into the eye of the public out here. 
 
I have mostly forgotten about it since I pass enough now that women don't usually clock me in the bathroom anymore.  But even though it's annoying that video is still floating around (in a negative way) it absolutely makes my month to know that the people I've met and know around Vegas like me and have my back. üíï posted to submission: A woman I've only met once messaged me today to tell me that she saw a video of a trans woman being mocked on Facebook, but recognized me and stood up for me. üòç

[20:08:16] Comment: dz10nea by islandgrrl82 : Depends. When you go from eating poorly and being inactive, suddenly eating only healthy, whole foods and exercising will have result in quick weight loss. I stopped eating fast food and junk, joined the gym, started walking more and easily lost 50 lbs. in 3-4 months. 

Also, if you stop eating something (like sugar or fast food) for a long period of time, you absolutely will feel sick when you eat it again. My sister stopped eating processed sugar over a year ago and she knows if something she eats has sugar in it (like say, a salad dressing) because she becomes horribly ill and gets a headache.

When you are eating clean, whole foods your body isn't used to processed foods anymore, so suddenly eating pizza or cake or what-have-you is more than likely going to make you feel sick and/or give you diarrhea at a minimum. That's pretty "normal". posted to submission: Is my[F26] boyfriend[27] trying to sabotage positive changes I'm making in my life or am I obsessed with healthy eating?

[20:08:47] Comment: dz10nem by daisyup : I wouldn't worry about personal projects.  I never had one, never had trouble getting a good job, and I went to a 3rd tier school and graduated in the great recession, so... my best guess is that personal projects are helpful for people who need them, meaning people who lack social skills to do well in an interview.  If you've already been successful getting some internships you don't need personal projects to get a good job.

However, when I'm on the hiring side of the desk, I know that personal projects make a candidate stand out \(because very few candidates have them, especially for entry level jobs\).  If you feel like you need a project to talk about in interviews, pick a school project that you liked particularly well and talk about that.  If you want to stand out in an interview, build something \(anything, a live wallpaper, stupid\-simple mobile app, or stupid\-simple web app will suffice\).  What you build matters a lot less than that you built & launched something and can speak intelligently about the process of developing and launching it.  You could even just tell people that you built \[whatever, a counter or random number display mobile app for example\] so that you could learn about the process of building and launching code.  You don't need to sound passionate about the project, low\-level curiosity will suffice.  The emphasis here is on launching.  I don't want to look through your github and neither does any other interviewer ever.  But I'm happy to pull up your app's page in the google play store and look at the screen shots. posted to submission: Programming is my career, but not my hobby.

[20:09:44] Comment: dz10nfs by theyetisc2 : in reality ANY grip is going to improve your shooting.

Unless of course it was originally designed to be incredibly awkward and make firing harder.

The lightweight grip looks like a vert grip with less plastic...

There's no reason "upgrades" should ever hurt other stats, especially considering grips.

Unless you do it intentionally, like making extended mags take longer to reload, but your rounds per minute still overall increase. posted to submission: Subreddit suggestion: replace the level 1 helmet downvote icon with a lightweight grip

They would have to spend $80-$110 for a set of the good tourney promos. Now i have never thought of the proxy idea and maybe thats something that can be mentioned more to new players worried about cost. And you are right most singles are cheaper and the way to go. My Dr. Myuu deck is seeing success and it cost me 12.50 lol. With all that said i absolutely love this game. Promos and amount of products should not drive anyone away.

[20:10:44] Comment: dz10ngk by tang81 : Because that's not what he said. That is just how it was interpreted. You can say whatever the fuck you want in an interview. It doesn't make it true or a criminal offense eligible for impeachment. 

A few days later, after Comey's ouster, Trump told NBC News' Lester Holt in an interview, "regardless of (Rosenstein's) recommendation, I was going to fire Comey."
"And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'" Trump said.


To me, it seems more of an aside than outright admitting to firing Comey for that reason. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.  But the only way to know for sure would be to get Trump to testify under oath. Which will probably never happen.  posted to submission: Should the Muller investigation offer proof of criminal activity on the part of Trump and as a result he is kicked out/resigns from office, would you hold any animosity towards the dems because of it?

[20:10:54] Comment: dz10ngt by refugefirstmate : Western Europe, generally (because each country has its own quirks):  Your income taxes would increase, and so would the sales taxes you pay.  Unless you're moving from e.g. San Francisco or Boston, your housing and utility costs per square foot would go up, and your living space would be smaller.   If you purchased real estate, you might not actually own the land on which your house sits, but instead would lease it for e.g. 99 years, which might interfere with what you would like to do on the land. You'd likely be unable to afford a car, but *if you lived in a city* you'd have good public transportation, which would be fine unless you needed to bring home something bulky, like building materials or a desktop PC or a 35 pound sack of dog food. 
 You'd pay more for most food, and you'd shop for it more frequently.  Your refrigerator, washer, and dryer (if you had one) would be smaller, as would be serving sizes at restaurants.   In most cases you would not be able to carry any means of self-defense, and whether you could lawfully defend yourself at all is not as clear-cut as in the US.  You could not defend your property.  You would find that certain subjects are off-limits, with legal penalties for writing, saying, or otherwise publishing certain things.  It would be easier, however, for you to sue for slander or libel.  Your tax dollars would pay for your children's education, in many cases including university or trade school. Your working hours would be shorter, your vacations longer, and it would be difficult to get fired. Your taxes would also pay for state-run medical care, so you would never receive a doctor bill, but whether you were eligible to receive the care would be in the government's hands, not yours, unless you wanted to pay out of pocket and sometimes not even then, depending on e.g. surgical waitlists. posted to submission: As an American living in the "free country," how would life change if I were to move say too...

[20:10:56] Comment: dz10ngw by CorruptMilkshake : Copying from a comment from u/JAWSUS_ here, because I'm lazy. Here they show a comparison of crop vs various factory farm deaths, and add to this a calorie adjusted death count for killing a deer.

> Here's one [estimate](https://i.imgur.com/By5Vfws.jpg) of how many vertebrates are killed during crop production. And source: http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc/

> If you killed a deer and got 50 usable pounds, then, because you can get around 800 calories per pound (highest estimate I could find plus about 100 calories to be safe) then that leaves you with 40000 calories. The graph above tells you how many deaths occur to get a million calories of food. So dividing a million by 40000, we get around 25 deer deaths per million calories, which is a significantly higher death toll than the number of wild animals killed during crop production.

[20:11:04] Comment: dz10vq3 by ExhibitionistCorgi : For a brunch reception, sticking to mimosas and Bloody Marys is probably going to be sufficient for everyone.  A good general rule is one drink per person per hour plus 25% for comfort (if you've got people who drink like it's their job, count them as two people).  So for you, eighteen people for four hours, plus the comfort room is 90 drinks.

[20:12:03] Comment: dz10vr1 by sighcology : the way the railroad works is based on not being an organisation that needs PR or support. having more than what is basically urban legend awareness would compromise them in a way that would make their operation non viable. they're a guerilla organization. it's why they work in cells, using dead drops and codenames. it protects them from infiltration, exposure and destruction. 

a different way to look at what they do (and why they don't help humans) is to compare them to say, medical research charities. you've got an organization dedicated to researching and curing multiple myeloma (a type of cancer that counts for like 0.07% of cancers) and someone might ask why they're not focusing on curing breast cancer (which is 25% of cancer diagnosis). and the answer is that there are already people out there doing something about that. but this cause is more niche, but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve or need people working on it.  posted to submission: People saying the Railroad is their least favourite faction in Fo4 due to their preachiness confuse me.

[20:12:06] Comment: dz10vr4 by DeejayNuKe : That would probably be possible. However I'm not sure how much outsourcing something like this costs. Especially since its on Unity, I'm sure there should be at least a few options for outsourcing. Its mainly a matter of how messed up their netcode programming is right now, and how complex it is. I'm assuming it is pretty complex / built on weak bases, otherwise it would've been improved a lot in the past year.

The more "messed up" or complex it is right now, the more expensive it can get. Its really up to them to see if they are willing to "invest" however much it costs, or if they are completely out of option, they might not have a choice sometime soon, before the game dies out completely posted to submission: Enjoying the game but...

[20:13:16] Comment: dz10vrq by Filmgeek47 : It's not an easy choice. I had both, then sold the vive to upgrade to the pro. The rift's big advantage right now is software development. There's simply more polished software that's exclusive to the rift \(and in the pipeline\). You can play some of it with revive, but the controls are generally more awkward and less intuitive because the games weren't designed with vive wands in mind. 

I'd look carefully to see if there's actually that many room scale games you see yourself playing regularly to justify the change. I've got a handful I come back to, but they all use some kind of artificial locomotion, so even in my 7 x9 ft space I don't have any trouble.

Other thing to consider is that the vive resolution looks noticeably worse than the rift, because it's a wider FOV with the same number of pixels, so things tend to be blurrier and the screen door is much more pronounced.

The pro is truly best of both worlds in this regard, as it's also solved the vive comfort issues, but it's obviously a small fortune to buy one at the moment.

I will say, it's going to be hard to go back to not having built\-in headphones. I'd budget for a DAS as part of your setup if you go forward with the vive. posted to submission: Vive or Rift?

[20:15:03] Comment: dz114dd by kchoze : Modernism rejects traditional narratives, but proposes new ones that are deemed to be based on reason and science. Marx for instance proposed his Marxist narrative of class struggle and dialectical materialism to explain all of human society evolution.

All of this is what I've been saying from the get-go and is confirmed by the intro of the Wikipedia article you've linked to:

"A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social **traditions**..."

"Modernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the **traditional** forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and even the sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world."

"More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a **socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology**"

That link confirms what I've said. posted to submission: Traditionalists vs Modernists vs Postmodernists

[20:15:14] Comment: dz114dh by Rumples : FYI: the type of memory the paper discusses is sensitizing aplysia to a tail shock. This differs from our normal conception of memory in that it's usually not specific to particular contexts, it just makes the snails more likely to respond to stimuli which directly affect particular neurons. Thus, using RNA to "transfer" sensitization to new animals could be generated by the specific impact of the RNA on those neurons. Mammalian memory is much more complex, and the neurons involved in a particular memory are most likely not predefined or consistent across animals. posted to submission: Scientists Transferred Memories From One Snail to Another.

[20:16:43] Comment: dz114es by Retired_Ninja_Turtle : In general, Google Maps and/or Waze is the way to go. Most of the time it will work for you on populated areas.

Waze is getting more and more reliable in many places, but some areas there are not enough users to give you a heads up with traffic and other events, but Google Maps will do fine. Another option is just to pay a cab to guide you to a central area with a parking lot and just walk through the place.

Also, if you're traveling to remote villages or areas with poor signal, it is advisable to load the entire route in Google Maps on the city before going out, maybe ask the locals (your hotel or a reliable-looking cab driver should provide tour options or at least the best route for the most remote areas).

Note: You can also use uber to guide you through many cities, but in some areas they are still "forbidden" by local goverment. Make sure to ask your uber driver if there are special actions you need to take if you are going to use the service (example: hide your phone once the uber ride has arrived, get in the front seat, be friendly to the driver as if he/she is part of your family or a close friend).

The east is amazing in food and variety of places to visit. In Quintana Roo state, you'll find tons of beaches. The most popular ones are 1) Cancun, which is quite expensive (even for foreigners), but 2) Playa del Carmen is a bit cheaper. Food is normally better in smaller towns than in those two beaches that I mentioned, though.

You might find "magical towns", these ones are very small tourist areas and you can pretty much cover the main attraction(s) in a day or two at most. Food is usually very cheap and great, but phone reception is NOT guaranteed nearby.

Ancient Ruins, [check this quick guide](https://hippie-inheels.com/the-5-best-ruins-to-visit-in-mexicos-yucatan-peninsula).

Even Mexico City has a lot to offer: Chapultepec Castle, Zoo, parks, tons of museums, temporary attractions, etc. Take the tour bus for a day, you can pay a ticket that is good for a day and you can even switch between lines (there are about 4 different routes). Bring your earphones to hear the tour in English.

And if this is the first time in Mexico, bring tons of sunscreen, in ancient ruins, you'll definitively need it. Mosquito repellent, it is not 100% effective, but it helps. Drinks lots of water to keep you hydrated, most places in the Eastern areas are very hot and humid, tropical weather, it can rain out of the blue.  posted to submission: How accurate are the travel times Google maps gives for driving in Mexico?

[20:16:51] Comment: dz114f0 by ychoed : Torva helms are only like 4-5m

Someone made a mistake and put an offer at over 10m expecting to get it at a lower price instantly but since it was the only one being sold on the grand exchange at the time it bought for exactly what his offer was.

OP is happy that he got a lot of extra money for the helm, but guilty that he is the one that completed that offer screwing over the other guy that bought it way over it's actual price. posted to submission: I feel happy but guilty

[20:17:28] Comment: dz114fj by noximo : Will it tie though?

I presume that A4 script will be as tightly guarded secret, if not more, than A3. 

A3 nods in current season so far feel like they were written based on the trailers. That doesn't matter much when both A3 and AoS are happening at the same time but it would be problem if you're forced to plot the whole season based on things that already happened but you have no idea what happened. 

I expect that they'll somehow sidestep the movies entirely so they won't need to deal with them. Travel to the future again or something like that. posted to submission: ‚ÄòAgents of SHIELD‚Äô Season 6 Delayed, to Air Summer 2019

[20:17:34] Comment: dz114fr by barsknos : Problem with golden hour, at least for this specific church, is that in the morning the sun will be behind mountains and in the evening you don't get the scenery towards the fjord. Also, given how impractically most of the stave churches are located geographically, getting a golden hour shot would often mean spending an extra night at a hotel to get it, which is really expensive and provide more weather uncertainty. 

But I look for the golden hour when possible :>

[20:18:56] Comment: dz11byr by j11430 : I agree with the point you're making but I did watch BEFORE WE GO recently and I gotta say it was lovely.

Though I do think there are still non-franchise movie stars.  Ryan Gosling I might say is a movie star.  Like I said before, Christian Bale sort of falls into that category (even though he was Batman I feel like he has 100% moved on from it).  Tom Hanks I'd argue is our best current male actor, which in my mind makes him a movie star, and he's not a franchise guy (the Dan Brown movies don't count because none of them exist).  There are still non-franchise movie stars but your point stands overall posted to submission: Have they ever talked about doing a miniseries on an actor?

[20:19:24] Comment: dz11bz5 by FireFoxG : >I'd love to see falsifiability in the context of climate change discussed more on this sub. 

The main point of this sub is to point out how horrible the predictions have been and there is no shortage of that to go around. 

I cant think of a single climate related prediction whos times has passed... that turned out to be in the right vector... let alone in the ballpark.  Of the predictions that have yet to pass... the trajectories of the actual data are in the complete wrong direction to the predictions(ie, Miami beach home prices, food production per acre, GDP, climate refugees, etc).

> The fact that it's not discussed here much is just because "skeptics" know that they're dealing with the unfalsifiable problem too.

What is this "too" part. You cant possibly be implying that the climate cult accepts it as unfalsifiable in the way skeptics do(in the vien of scientifically testable hypothesis). If you even dare question the claims "we need to do something now, or we are doomed"... you are instantly branded a hertic and exiled from the cult. You could say they treat it as unfalsfiable... because they treat the predictions as absolute forgone conclusions. Apparently you missed the memo... "The Debate is Over" they keep saying. posted to submission: Climate Exaggeration is Backfiring on Alarmists

The first argument hinges on the way how "popularized" is interpreted. If 100.000 people in a 300 nation is considered popular the author has a point. If not he doesnt.

The second argument hinges on the change of players in the same game: worker - capitalist vs victim - oppressor. AFAIK that's also the reason why it's neo-marxism. posted to submission: Getting the Culprits Right, JBP and Communism

Yes there are groups (I'm in 1), where people teach others for free and host learning sessions. Some requirements are in place there too. It's just to basically act so that people aren't just here to leech for 1 kill then leave, but actually show an interest in making an effort to learn the boss, be better at the boss, and do the boss.

How many people have actually made more than 1 attempt at joining like a bossing Friends Chat or clan or community? There's a shit ton of masses Friends Chats too. Most I see, for example at AOD, **don't even make an effort to try and learn better strategies** for better smaller teams. They don't ask for more knowledge.

[20:25:15] Comment: dz11s2v by flip69 : Thank You for asking,

While the Jackson species are mountain cool weather animals they are not cold and dry air species.  (think cloud forest)

Also all the "jacksons" you'll see in the pet store for under $300 are from Hawaii (T. J. Xantholophus)  they're an invasive species and more adapted to warmer Hawaiian temps. 

____

So while I appreciate the interest your son has for an exotic, all the chameleon species are "intermediate" level animals in terms of care.  I usually don't sell my animals to anyone that's a not in college (age) it just takes too much.

As far as shuttling between homes, these species are not roaming animals, they acquire a territory and stay / defend that area all their lives.   Ask anyone around here and it's standard for a cham to not eat for 72 hours after a move and being put into a new location.  Even if you haul it's cage and equipment around it's still going to be see everything outside of the confines of that cage and "freak out" enough so it'll hide and not eat or drink. 

Then there's the specifics for trying to care for a cham in your local climate.  That's a uphill struggle for sure. 
Successful people have dedicated rooms that they keep their animals in or custom environmental setups.

So if you're really well off and want to throw over a grand into each custom habitat/room...  that's one hurdle.

But then again you're dealing with relocating stresses. 

Your right to be concerned... I wouldn't recommend it.
Tell him it's something to work towards as a college student. 

Till then how about a bearded dragon?
IF he wants a bragging item, I know a few good breeders that have have unbelievable animals.

I know it may seem a lot now, but I figure if you plan on owning the car for 10 years, then you will be able to afford the payments more years than not.

In that case, it just makes sense to go tits out on a big purchase like this.

Besides, if you do any amount of long range driving, I cannot stress on how much of a game changer eyesight is.

Also, the leather interior, the harmon kardon sound system.  All these little things add up to give you an amazing driving experience which you can enjoy for a long time.

Its been balanced to not have a bonus. Giving it an ability bonus would be minor, but probably fine in your game. For overall balance its better that it does not.

As for how strong flight is, I have one simple argument that usually gets people. Swimming speed is just as strong as flying speed. They are situationally strong. If you're going underwater, swim speed completely dominates. If you're in the mountains or atop castle walls, flying speed dominates. If you're in a deep dungeon, neither movement type is remotely useful.

So which environment are you in? All of those? Only open air and dungeons? Underwater campaign or a story that follows a river?

Its also worth noting that flying can be easily countered (more easily than swimming). A couple archers in every enemy group will quickly put an end to a flying race's desire to fly around every battle with impunity. posted to submission: How strong is flight on an elf?

The laws assuring a fair trial,  are not about any one case. They are not about OJ or the EAR. They are about each of us having confidence in our system, so that we don't have to be afraid of our government and each other. These rules are embraced, so that if we or someone we love, is ever mistakenly accused of any crime, they will get a fair trial and won't be lynched or falsely convicted.

There is a choice that each of us must make. Given an imperfect system, would we rather have a system that errs to insure that the innocent are not punished or one that errs and lets the occasional bad guy go free. I am not saying that one or the other is right.

For myself, I say let the bad guy go free once in awhile. He will just be that much easier to catch and convict the next time.

Lord only knows how easily and often, innocent people and their families, pay for crimes they did not commit. How many innocent people have been executed? How many are too many?

More to the point, if the purpose of the 2A is so that the populace could rise up against a tyrant (which is highly debatable to begin with), then the founders erred *spectacularly* in the presumption that gun owners would not simply side with said tyrant.  Because I'd bet that if Trump cancelled all future American elections tomorrow, more than half of the gun owners in America would support him.

I don't mean to vilify all gun owners (I have several in my family, and they are sane and reasonable people), but the volume of them that cosplay as constitutional originalists while proudly waving a traitor's flag convinces me that, as a stopgap against tyranny, the Second Amendment would (if ever thoroughly tested) prove to be *spectacularly* counterproductive. posted to submission: Schiff: Trump deal with ZTE a ‚Äòviolation of the emoluments clause

Remember, sight reading depends on at least these two things:
1) your technique, and 2) your ability to read.

If you can read really well, but you can't play really well, you will be roadblocked.   If you can play really well, but can't read really well, you'll still be road blocked.

You have to constantly diagnose which area needs the most work, and focus on that.

It is also very useful to play lots of VERY EASY pieces of music to work on these skills.   WE are all tempted to go beyond our real ability in order to feel good about ourselves.

[20:26:57] Comment: dz11s47 by squatsasquatch : Hey, I feel you. I remember exposing my status to 80 times to strangers whom I wasn‚Äôt sure would be sympathetic to my situation so I could find out which of the 80-some med schools would consider looking at my app, which would give me aid, etc. Note, I couldn‚Äôt find their policy on the MSAR because I did not have DACA and I didn‚Äôt know a single person in my shoes (I am a stateless undocumented person who does not qualify for any refugee visas or DACA).

I also used to think my status was such a red flag that I had to be the most extraordinary applicant. I couldn‚Äôt give schools any other reasons to reject me aside from the fact that I was undocumented. If you‚Äôre thinking this way, please don‚Äôt. Be kind to yourself and nurse your mental health for the long run.

It was awful to get those emails saying, ‚Äúsorry, we don‚Äôt accept undocumented students‚Äù or even worse‚Äîemails asking, ‚Äúwhat is DACA? Please refer to our page for international students.‚Äù But as demoralizing as those disqualifying emails were, there were also schools that encouraged me to apply, reassuring me they would not discriminate based on immigration status. Albeit, those schools are few in number and extremely hard to get into, but just give it a go and know that you have a place in medicine and you deserve to achieve your dreams and give back to your community. 

There are millions of undocumented people in this country, many more who will lose their status from loss of TPS. I know they are not criminals, that they fled their countries for valid reasons, that they contribute billions of dollars of taxes every year to the benefit of this country, that they are integral members of our society. But they are also treated poorly and face enormous barriers to healthcare. I think you and I know better than most about what our community goes through and I believe the only thing I can do is keep striving. Don‚Äôt give up!

For those who say go back to your country, screw em. My home is here and there are many goals I would like to accomplish here‚Äîincluding things that would help people who don‚Äôt want me here.

Maybe there's a similar plan in motion here that leaves Rocksteady unable to show off anything without breaking some kind of NDA/contract/embargo/whatever would be applicable in this situation.

Alternatively, what if there is only a trailer to show off at the moment? If they show it now and there isn't enough of the next build to show at E3, they're not going to be able to do much except stand on the stage and go "*Yep. This game exists.

>This is, as Yuval Levin put it, an investigation about itself. Trump skeptics within the administration laid a legal minefield all around the president, and then Trump ‚Äî being Trump ‚Äî stomped all over it, blowing himself up six ways from Sunday.

That argument is false.   At the time the isssue was not even   "about" Trump.  Where he stomped has not been good.  But it was   about the Trump campaign  and the fact that we were attacked.  But it has taken some time for us come to grips with all of it and the article was written in June last year.  I'd have to go back and find when Papadopoulos was turned. 

He also says this:

>I‚Äôm not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be an investigation into potential Russia-Trump links. Russia‚Äôs attack on American democracy was truly heinous, and if the Trump people were involved, that would be treason. I‚Äôm saying first, let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves and assume that this link exists.

[20:27:32] Comment: dz11zjt by aibohphobia321 : >I think people who really want Rey to be related think Kylo makes the trio look bad, and so they need Rey to be kind of a second shot kid, someone who was ripped from them unjustly which is what made them fail Kylo which is how the Skywalker line will be redeemed when Rey kills Kylo and takes her place in the family. 

Yes, sorry to get a little off topic, but this is just like all the Poe is the son Leia never had stuff that makes me so mad. I think the Twitter account for *Star Wars Legacy* tried to imply this again this past Mother's Day, and it spurred a lot of discourse which some saw as Poe bashing. I think a tiny bit was, but most of the discourse I think was sincere and was just pointing out Poe's flaws. For me that doesn't mean that I think Ben doesn't have flaws, but the people who try to paint Poe as the son Leia should have, imo, see Poe as being a perfect Han clone, and see Ben as a bad seed. 

A lot of these people even ship Damerey or see it as a possibility despite the fact that they only met in the second film and barely spoke to each other. Not to mention the fact that I think it was major foreshadowing that Poe wants to burn the First Order down even after Rose's message about saving what you love instead of fighting what you hate, and even with Rey being rightfully angry for Ben for good reason, she's not going to have a "no quarter, no prisoners" thoughts towards them. 

>Where as for the rest of us, it just seems like the third movie is really late to suddenly cram in all this mythology about what happened to put Rey on Jakku, and it would still paint the trio in a bad light considering no one talks at all about losing a child. You could give them amnesia or something, but again--it seems rather forced.

Yes, we still need to know what happened that night at the Temple, and who the Knights of Ren are and the answer to other mystery boxes that JJ Abrams introduced in *TFA*. As far as I'm concerned the question of Rey's parentage has been answered and is satisfactory to me, and while maybe can get a flashback or two in EPIX to see more about her younger life, to introduce this whole thing with either Luke and/or Leia and Han sending her off after the night at the Luke's Temple because they feared that Ben would kill her would come out of nowhere and take way too long to explain, and would make the OT look bad, and wouldn't fit in with how they're written or how Ben and even Snoke are written. 

If Rey was a Skywalker, Snoke probably would have killed Ben since he wasn't getting the results he wanted from him, and made Rey his new apprentice since he was already tempted to do that before. Her having precious Skywalker blood would have just sealed the deal, but since he considered her unimportant, he was okay with her being offed. 

Also, Ben has always been honest with Rey, so I'm not sure why he wouldn't bring that up to disillusion her about Luke especially when she first believes Luke's version of events that night.

I guess you've never been in a situation where your manager blames his/her failures on the incompetence of his/her team and you all get laid off and replaced while they get to keep their job.

To answer your question, it depends on your goals in life, what you like and what not.

Some people are happy with their current position, others are in constant disagreement with the powers that be so they move up to change the directions. It all boils down to happiness.

2. If asked to take side then take side with suitable case laws and remember your first case should be a well know/leading authority (every standard book have it). If not then write arguments from both sides

3. Conclude with a suitable reasoning relating all the legal provision.

PS. Suitable sections and case laws are key for building arguments, relate as many relevant Acts possible and for better understanding read any good judgment.

By all means, nothing special. Studio's that are less than 400 square feet that have shared floor-wide bathrooms and common cooking areas. But something. 


If you can't make the working poor's life comfortable in your city- lowering the cost of living is far more sustainable from an economic standpoint than trying to artificially raise wages and impose bullshit policies like rent control- you will eventually reach a point where the cost a living increases endlessly until the city can't even provide basic services because police and fire don't want to take the effective pay cut.

[20:29:22] Comment: dz11zlu by abhishkk65 : Perfect timing for your question lol. Just fixed my issue by doing this.

What I had done before I encountered black screen login on normal boot:

1. Everything works fine in 17.10
2. upgraded from 17.10 to 18.04
3. black screen login issues
4. purged all installed nvidia drivers from apt
5. booted in recovery mode with integrated graphics
6. installed latest nvidia-396 drivers
7. booted in PCI display mode and got black screen, but works in recovery mode

You'll notice this didn't fix anything, but now I had the latest drivers since I was using nvidia-390 before. I posted my question after these steps. What I did after based on this [1] and this [2]:

1. Login through recovery mode with PCI display mode.
2. Opened /etc/default/grub to edit (Will need sudo to edit)
3. Replaced `quiet splash` with `nomodeset`.
4. save and close file
5. Run `sudo update-grub`
6. Boot/login normally (no recovery mode) and everything works.

In retrospect, purging all drivers was probably unnecessary, but everyone I searched online recommended it and I would have upgraded the drivers anyways so not a big deal. At no point do I use nouveau or try nouveau since I have no intention of using the nouveau drivers.

[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/8jjkym/ubuntu_1804_only_booting_in_recovery_mode_after/dz0b083/
[2] https://www.howtogeek.com/196655/how-to-configure-the-grub2-boot-loaders-settings/

P.S. I'm not sure if your issue is the exact same as mine since I never had to run `fsck`. I also vaguely remember having some black screen login issues when I setup by new PC and installed 17.04. I remember googling and doing some stuff with `splash` and `nomodeset`, but I forgot until now when I did it again. I'll probably never forget now.

[20:29:42] Comment: dz1250r by aasukisuki : Probably not.  When you're logged onto your server, the kerberos ticket you have is issued to that machine.  So when you open the browser, and connect to the API on the same machine, there's no hop.  But when you go from that API to another (presumably on a different machine) you have a single hop, and the ticket is validated (b/c that machine can obviously give it's own ticket away for validation).

When you are not on your server, your kerberos ticket is issued for the machine you are on (which your browser accesses).  That ticket is then handed to your back end api on your server (1 hop) and works.  If/When your api calls API 2 (2nd hop) the ticket invalidates since delegation doesn't seem to be set up properly in your Active Directory, because your server isn't allowed to hand the ticket from your machine to another machine and claim to be you.

[20:29:48] Comment: dz1250x by JCmathetes : Gentiles were not yet allowed into the Covenant community. Among Israel's issues was they did not represent God well due to their actions, not their lack of evangelism. 

The nations, further, were deceived not because of a lack of evangelism, but because of Satan's power over them. Hence his temptation of Jesus in Luke 4:5-6: 

> And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, ‚ÄúTo you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will."

Jesus, in rejecting Satan on his home turf in the wilderness, establishes that *He* has the right to claim them as the Son of God. Jesus, thus, revokes Satan's ability to deceive the nations in his incarnation and victory of death and sin in the resurrection/ascension.  posted to submission: Amils- was Lucifer bound when Christ died/rose, in 70 AD, or ?

[20:30:29] Comment: dz1251n by rockandlove : LOL "BS" I've served on a jury so I'm pretty sure I know exactly how it works.

  Despite what you may think, a jury is absolutely NOT a check in place against "immoral laws."  Those laws are CREATED by the executive branch (Congress/President) of the government.  The purpose of the judicial branch (court system) of the government is to INTERPRET the laws.  And as any intro law class would tell you, morality does not equate to legality...which is exactly why a jury is instructed by the judge to disregard their personal feelings.  Every day judges and juries decide rulings and sentences based on the law even if they don't personally agree with said law.  

  Since you're woefully uninformed, allow me to explain what exactly the "hell the point of a jury is" even though you could've easily googled it but I guess it's easier to be ignorant right?  The SOLE purpose of a jury is because it is a Constitutionally guaranteed right to be tried...in front of a jury of your peers.  This is to prevent potentially corrupt judges from handing down unfair verdicts.  Jurors are not legal experts and in fact a judge can override a jury's decision and that does happen.  A jury does exactly what a judge does, they take a look at the criteria of the charged crimes.  The jury then decides if, all other factors considered, the actions of the defendant meet the legal criteria for the crimes with which they're charged.  A jury can RECOMMEND a judge gives an easy/hard sentence to a defendant but that decision is ultimately left to the judge.

  So...no.  It is not at all your right as a citizen to disavow the legal criteria of a crime.  If you do so and it affects the jury's outcome you will be called to explain your reasoning.  If you are objecting to a verdict on moral grounds you will be replaced as an alternate and/or charged with contempt. posted to submission: This New Bill In Congress Would Imprison People For 10 Years If They Injure A Cop

[20:32:10] Comment: dz1252t by redhotchilitopepper : Pues les contar√© una historia que le sucedi√≥ a la familia. MI padre QEPD ten√≠a su oficina ah√≠ por la escuela electr√≥nica. Al momento de comprar una propiedad atr√°s y querer construir es donde comienza lo interesante..Yo ten√≠a si mal no recuerdo unos 5-6 a√±os y cuando iba a la construcci√≥n me comentaban que se sent√≠an como que vibras raras. En una de esas el "maistro" al momento de estarse cambiando para retirarse cuenta que ten√≠a una espejo colgado de la pared, y de repente comenz√≥ a temblar muy fuerte (solo el espejo) hasta el punto en que cay√≥ y se rompi√≥.


Despu√©s al momento de excavar mencionan que encontraron objetos antiguos, ropa, herramienta etc y cuentan que una vez unos trabajadores vieron a un se√±or parado en una esquina de la construcci√≥n haci√©ndoles se√±as para que fueran, fueron hasta donde estaba el se√±or y no hab√≠a nadie. De la misma manera me dec√≠an que hab√≠an encontrado unos t√∫neles con aire muy fri√≥ que sal√≠a de su interior, me dijeron que hab√≠a centenarios dentro de los t√∫neles pero ya no quisieron seguirle en la construcci√≥n.

Ya despu√©s gente que ha entrado al edificio ha dicho que sienten una vibra rara y personas que han trabajado ahi dicen que ven una sombra que pasa de cuarto en cuarto

Me puse a investigar y supuestamente esos t√∫neles conectan todo el centro de MTY, alameda y el obispado y seg√∫n esto es como se transportaban durante la batalla de MTY(si no me equivoco) para no ser vistos.

Tiempo despu√©s trabaj√© en una empresa por el Obispado y lo mismo, habia paredes en la casa que estaban tapadas y hab√≠a un cuarto que tenia como una puerta que daba hacia un tunel. La abr√≠ e inmediatamente sent√≠ el mismo aire frio que como anteriormente lo hab√≠a mencionado.

[20:32:48] Comment: dz1253c by IamMenace : I know what you mean, friend.  I fell in love with reading fanfiction shortly into Volume 2's hiatus, so much so that I even began writing my own.  Many of RWBY's characters started off as "blank slates" for lack of a better word, and while it might be frustrating as a fan it can be just as inspiring as a fanfic writer.

A *lot* has changed even since Volume 3, and I think many people even look at certain characters differently than they once did.  The blank slates still exist but sometimes a little wrinkle is added that just doesn't sit well with some people.  Learning that Blake has a loving family for instance, not to mention all the world building that has been hit or miss for some.  Plus you can argue RWBY is more plot driven than character driven these days, and for a lot of people I think they'd be fine with their favorite characters climbing trees to escape the villains throwing rocks at them.

I don't really consider myself a fan of the show these days, and probably won't watch much of Volume 6, but I'm still in love with RWBY and writing fanfiction, and to be honest it kinda surprises me sometimes just how many people read/write fanfiction but don't watch the show.  I think that's rather telling, and for myself I want to capture that initial feeling I felt when watching the Red Trailer and when I was first introduced to the characters for the very first time.  A lot of Volume 3-5 elements work their way into my fics but I try to write them from a Volume 1 or 2 perspective if that makes sense.

I hope you find plenty of stories that make you feel "nostalgic", friend.

God bless, and have a *wonderful* day. posted to submission: Does anybody miss the days from V1 - V3 fanfiction?

Oh good. Now we're getting into specifics. What constitutes a game designed for children to you? What don't Mario and Pokemon have that you think is necessary for a video game targeted at kids? What examples would you give of games that are targeted at kids?

> Experience is no argument. And nice try but I have weasel out of nothing, I've argued and destroyed every point you tried to bring. I haven't used any "made up falsehood" either". With that out the way, I'll continue.

You have lied about them being children. They are not. This isn't an argument from authority. It's a fact. Your ignorance on the subject doesn't change that fact. The characters are adults so it isn't paedophilia. Of course, this whole argument is ignoring the fact that they are fictitious, animated horses that don't exist and not children.

> They are drawn like child horses. They're drawn with features like childish horses. Oh, and so you know, ponies are still like horses and are actually indeed stockier like you wrote, which is nothing like the ponies in MLP. This info comes from my cousin who has worked her entire life with ponies and horses: see, my source has more authority than yours, therefore I must be right. At least that's the kind of argument of authority that you think works.

The ponies in my little pony are stylised. That is why their eyes are bigger than their bodies. They *are* stocky and they *are* ponies. The title is My Little **Pony** for god's sake. Also, your source doesn't actually disagree with me so I find it funny you even mentioned it. What makes them look like foals and not stylised ponies?

> Once again, you looked at something, refused to admit the facts about it and took bad faith as an argument. You don't think that's bad form for the conversation?

It's not bad form to point out you have no knowledge of what you're talking about. You assumed they were children. In the show they were not, therefore your assumption was wrong. Am I supposed to ignore the fact that your argument was based on something that just isn't true?

> I honestly don't care what conclusion you came up either, because you have nothing to back it up. Again, I don't need to watch any episode to tell you what the drawing it looks like. It looks like ponies that aren't adult. They are even called little in the title. You are even contradicting the title of the show, that's how far your bad faith will go.

They have jobs. They live in their own homes. There are actually children in the show to which they can be compared. What you think the drawings look like have no effect on the actual context of the show. You want proof? The main character owns a library. One of the secondary characters works in a bakery all the main characters but one live alone in their own houses (at least in the episodes I saw). The one who doesn't live alone lives with her grandmother, brother and **little sister** on a farm. This **little sister** *is* in fact a child and has a few friends that appear in various episodes. These children are notably smaller than the adult main characters and go to school, don't have jobs and live with others. Therefore, no matter what you think the drawings look like, the characters are in fact adults. Also, how you can tell the age of an extremely stylised horse with eyes bigger than it's body is beyond me.


> They are even called little in the title. You are even contradicting the title of the show, that's how far your bad faith will go.

Little doesn't mean child. Children tend to be small but not everything that is small is a child. You want a history lesson? The reason they're called My **Little** Pony is because the show is based on a series of Hasbro toys. The toys were smaller than an actual pony. There. That's it. The name existed before the characters did.

 I have no 'bad faith'. I just want you to admit you know jackshit about what you're arguing, that you're constantly assuming things and that your bias against the show comes from a place of pure ignorance. This idea of bad faith is meaningless. You came into this conversation thinking that everyone who likes a TV shoe must be a paedophile. That is bad faith.


> The line is exactly here: when the subject of arousal is young.

Well, the main characters of My Little Pony demonstrably aren't. Problem fucking solved.

> Which is ... basically what you're doing. You've weasel out of everything, have commited several logical fallacies and now are trying to discredit me instead of arguing. Congratulations, it's not often that I see someone managing to accuse someone of something and to do it at the same time. :D Don't change, champion.

I haven't weaseled out of anything. Any time you've asked me something, I've answered. Any point you've made, I've addressed. You've made false claims that you would know are false if you actually had a basic understanding of the subject which you have already stated you do not. Why argue about something you clearly don't understand?

> Alright, game's over. You proved to have exactly nothing to contributed except bad faith and plugging your years while singing as loud as you can. You have also proven to be disinterested in any form of conversation, but to keep defending peadophilia. Sorry that I am not interested in talking to you ever again. Now I will do just as HotS taught me: mute and bye bye.

That's ironic coming from someone who's entire argument was based on a total misunderstanding. Being attracted to fictional, adult, anthropomorphic horses is weird but it certainly isn't paedophilia. Go and enjoy your blind ignorance.

[20:38:28] Comment: dz12mkm by mechathatcher : Someone has knowingly, through exploiting a whole in your (sorry) crappy website, extracted money from you. If you do something like this on purpose (the first time sounds like a mistake, then he ramped it up big time for the second go) then that is fraud. The police don't understand what you're talking about that's why they are palming you off.

More importantly you want your money back. Have you asked for it? Maybe not by phoning up and asking nicely, but your livelihood is at stake. Pay the couple of hundred quid to the solicitor to draft you s letter asking for your money back.

If this is someone that does this sort from thing all the time it will be difficult. But if it is some idiot who thinks they've just found the magic money tree then they won't want it to cost them more money in the long run. So maybe they'll just give it back? posted to submission: ¬£21k stolen after customer found way to exploit returns system

Of course, every rule has that damn exception. Like the SUPER FOX 10/10 I had on a maternity clinical - and I hated those days. Pregnant ladies and babies are gross and not my bag. But this chick glowed and was just so godamn sexy. I had to gtfo after assisting her.

Didn't say that either. But don't act like a millionaire getting off scott free from a heinous act is some great story. If his "career" at 19 was working behind a register for minimum wage he would have received a fair punishment at the time and you wouldn't have given a shit.

They're also the better defensive team. LeBron is going to single handily will this series to 6 or 7 games because he's incredible, but Cavs don't necessarily have to win tonight to win the series, and I think LeBron needs another game to digest how the Celts are coming at them before figuring out how to beat em.

[20:44:24] Comment: dz12x3g by mokulen22 : For context, I'm Female.

I brought up my asexuality fairly early on to avoid any misunderstandings. We dated normally, always being open and honest. My situation was a little easier as my partner was on anti-depressions that lowered her natural drive. 

I'm not sex repulsed, but I wont initiate physical contact. That burden would always fall on my partner - she had to be open with me and tell me when she felt rejected, lonely, or I was being too distant. 

As long as I was emotionally intimate, she was happy...we talked a lot -- I hated talking about "feelings" but I did it for her -- It was my way of showing I cared or was infested in the relationship. 

Bring lesbians we moved in together after a few months (Uhal stereo-type is a stereo-type for a reason haha). We had separate bedrooms -- which I know is weird for a couple -- but it worked for us. 

Any thing you need to know -- you can IM me or ask here.

[20:44:32] Comment: dz12x3k by Damascene_Arab : Can that world derive it's existence from itself, for simplification you can imagine this eternal world as a chain of causes or frames (like a video) that each gives birth what's after it and is dependent on what's before it, stretching to infinity. Every cause/frame is like a zero; it can‚Äôt bring anything into existence independently and it can‚Äôt come into existence **independently**, it's contingent. Otherwise we will have to question causes and reasons.

In this example zero means contingent and by million I'm referring to the universe.

If I write a zero and tells you that it equals a million you will logically ask from where did this zero get this million. If I wrote another zero before it and told you that it got it from this zero it'll still be illogical as zero is a weak number. If I kept on writing zeros trying to deceive you by an infinite number of zeros that this zero got the million from the one before it and that zero got the million from the zero before it it'll still be zero unless I write a number like one, something that can exist independently then the zeros are still zero and can't have million as a value. therefore there needs to be a start which everything else takes their existence from.

Conclusion: Infinite zeros doesn't mean anything, the universe can't derive it's existence from itself so being **cyclic** or eternal is meaningless. posted to submission: The Cosmological Argument only works by making an unfounded assumption

[20:47:14] Comment: dz138h9 by nullagravida : I used to read some novels set in a historical time when people signed official letters, and/or sent verbal messages thru a messenger, that weren‚Äôt complete without a long, long string of ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù compliments and greetings related to the recipient‚Äôs rank. I wondered why in the world anyone would waste their time and effort with that and then I realized: leaving the greetings *out* was a subtle way of dissing the receiver. There is no world in which a diplomat could insult the ruler of the country he was sent to negotiate with‚Äî but boy howdy, if the Queen of XYZ told her diplomat to sort of forget to use one of the Sultan of Y‚Äôs honorifics... well, *that* sent a message. 

So it is today with sneezes. Of course you don‚Äôt think Satan will snatch a dude‚Äôs soul away if you forget to say ‚Äúbless you‚Äù, ‚Äúgesundheit‚Äù, ‚Äúyou ok?‚Äù or even ‚Äúcover your mouth!‚Äù. But saying nothing at all is a clear signal: *‚ÄùYou are a stranger to me‚Äù* or, possibly, *‚ÄùDemonstrating the fact that I don‚Äôt play by society‚Äôs rules is more important to me than ackowledging you‚Äù*. Either way, it‚Äôs commission by omission.

I can't tell where he is at in reference to the plant box, so if he was straight above, might as well just ride it out.  More often than not, you'll end up somewhere relatively soft, and even where he ended up wasn't too bad because the fall was relatively controlled as he comes down.

[20:49:18] Comment: dz138ip by outlawa : I think you just go on with life. Do the things that interest you. Work on yourself. And everything else will fall into place. 

I'm far from being a looker. When I divorced my 1st wife around age 30 or so my job also transferred me to a different state. So not only was I single but I was also in a new area where I did not know anyone. I decided that I needed to get into shape and started biking. I remember one day while I was unloading the bike from the car after hitting the paths a lady that lived in the apartment complex approached me and struck up a conversation that she was also into biking and perhaps one day we could go for a ride. 
The result of that was I wasn't really interested in her so the ride never actually happened. But there was one instance of when I wasn't even looking for a relationship when something could have blossomed. 

When I did start looking things were not very difficult. 
What I think it most important: Be yourself. I had 4 women from my job that showed interest (one worked at a location out of the country in Canada). One I turned down because I was getting a bit serious with another person by the time she invited me out. The  second and third I did date for a while. The fourth became my wife after dating for about 4 years. 

Before them I did try the "hot service" at the time: match.com. Where I met 3 women who I dated for a while. 

But during all this time I didn't try to be anything more than what I was. Some guy that was divorced. No children. Working 5 days a week. Kind of a homebody that enjoyed video games that had been working to increase my activity level through exercise. 
I showed curiosity in what they liked. They did the same for me and we were able to determine just from what would be considered small talk if we had any further interest in each other.  posted to submission: I have ended my DB

The assistant job wasn't available and obviously going to City was a good move for him. It just feels strange. You'd have expected more stuff from Wenger like 'Arteta is very smart and helps out, he could be a great coach someday'. posted to submission: Daily Discussion [2018-05-15]

[20:49:32] Comment: dz138j0 by recycledpaper : Our assistant PD would hound us for pictures of us doing "chill" things at work like eating ice cream or having an impromptu dance break because that's "wellness". We did an exercise about "personality colors"...And then an attending made fun of the "emotional colors" (wtf).  And then we had a lecture that basically said physicians are terrible at taking care of themselves and it's their fault for getting depressed because they can't set boundaries. I had to go cry in the bathroom because I felt like my depression was my fault. 

You know what would contribute to my wellness? Attendings who maybe took an interest in my learning. Not having to lie about my duty hours. Not doing a bunch of stupid modules so the hospital can get some dumb certification. Nurses who follow my orders. Time to spend with my family without feeling guilty.

[20:49:46] Comment: dz13i14 by Nnylaryt : My son also started talking roughly at three. But speech is alot to process, your key goal should always be communication first because the reality is that children don't always speak. I know it's hard to accept sometimes and your looking for hope, but I find that false hope isn't always helpful. Sorry if that was too blunt but autistic adults can live full happy lives without speech. What's important is that he's understood and has a way to connect with you. My son really took to signing prior to speech, and I sometimes wonder if we accidentally took the pressure off the process. We started with yes, no, help, all done, and stop. Once that foundation was built we were able to follow it up with more elaborate signing. We also firmly respected what was being relayed to us to help form trust. If he signed stop, we stopped, everytime. When he started talking the first thing I realized is that he would over explain and still gesture to make sure we understood him, indicating that he had known that we couldn't understand him the entire time.  posted to submission: Late talkers

Foles on the other hand had to get his playbook shortened to an extent along with being changed, Foles can't really run the whole scheme, you saw that early in the first half against the Giants until they finally started to pick up.. same against Falcons and Raiders. posted to submission: Bird team QB will be in discussion for GOAT in the future despite having never won a playoff game yet.

[20:52:07] Comment: dz13i24 by CashKing52 : I just posted this, will post it again here for you Defoler.  I showed this to my brother, and he had zero compassion on this, said " That‚Äôs really bad, but the same thing happens on occasion to American children, which is also bad.¬† Don‚Äôt you think the parents share a bit of responsibly by breaking the law and putting their children in that position to start with.¬† If a parent robbed a bank and took their kids along and the child got hurt, who‚Äôs fault is that?¬† The law enforcers are the parent? "  I think our American foster care system albeit flawed is a little more tougher on the vetting of potential foster care parents, but in this article it sounds like there is zero serious vetting and so these immigrant children who have already been traumatized in their own countries are now being abused, neglected and sold because this administration doesn't give a flying fuck about any serious vetting or making sure that these kids are taken care of.  My brothers whole take is "They are breaking the law coming here, so they are criminals, and the parents are to blame for this"!  Not that they are refugees seeking horrible conditions that we can't even imagine making the trek to America in hopes of saving their kids lives and getting help.  America really has turned into a soulless nation when we start rationalizing this type of treatment of immigrant children.  posted to submission: Almost 1,500 Migrant Children Placed in Homes by the U.S. Government Went Missing Last Year

[20:58:49] Comment: dz141c6 by boy-robot : Honestly, while I'll admit I don't know anything about your relationship, there's a good chance her going to the cabin has nothing to do with you. She's probably not going up there to cheat or to leave you. "Finding yourself" is a legit goal and I can totally imagine myself taking a few days alone to do just that - can't you? It wouldn't mean I was trying to leave my live-in partner. Sometimes you just want a change of scenery for a minute. So keep that in mind.

I'd also recommend finding stuff to do while you're on your own - maybe you've got something you've been putting off? Could your place use a clean-up? Maybe try cooking or baking something for yall to share when she gets back? Or just do you-things, aside from drinking. Hang out with friends. Catch a movie that you'd enjoy that she might not. A few days of separation can actually be pretty fun and healthy if you let them. Check in with us here on /sd as often as you need to, even just to say "hey, made it to the end of another day, still didn't drink". You'll get back-pats and encouragement galore.

Also, I gotta second what the other commenter said. Whenever I've accepted an excuse to just drink out of boredom/loneliness, no matter how good of an idea it seemed at the time, I've regretted it later.  posted to submission: My partner is going toa cabin to find herself or some shit and I'm worried about relapsing

[20:59:35] Comment: dz141cx by reedrothchild5 : I read the whole thing. It was easy to get through and I enjoyed it for the most part. The action lines were engaging, although there were times I found they distracted from the story. Some examples I noted along the way: 

-Joe‚Äôs excited as a 12-year old before laser tag
-mike and rita are ruining his adventure
-you could hear a moth fart in the store right now

The first two were images I already had in my head so they didn‚Äôt really add anything. The third just felt jarring during a tense moment of conflict. There were some more of these, but I didn‚Äôt write all of them down. A lot of that stuff is personal taste though so if you like it, keep it. 

I haven‚Äôt seen The Thing so that page and a half of dialogue went over my head. It was kind of frustrating because it was the first time I was getting to hear the characters converse. That said, it was still easy enough to understand the relationship dynamics laid out from the conversation. 

I think the relationship between Joe and his dad could use some more depth/exploration. If you make Joe a suspect based on the hair planting, that‚Äôd be a good opportunity to delve deeper. It came off as a bit surface-level. Maybe throw in a scene where they visit the mom‚Äôs grave or something too. That was touched on pretty briefly and I think there‚Äôs potential for more with that idea. 

I thought the Mike/Rita relationship got a bit redundant. They hook up pretty early then the story kind of hit on the same beat of them hiding the relationship until the end. 

Was chocolate coke a real thing or a typo? I grew up in the nineties and don‚Äôt remember it.

[20:59:55] Comment: dz141d4 by tendeuchen : >Except there aren't 64 days in a month 

Our months are arbitrary constructs. Some have 30 days. Some have 31. And one only has 28, except when it has 29. Those are just arbitrary delineations of the period of orbit around the sun. 

Our new calendar consists of 5 months of 64 days each: Febwark, Mabriy, Juny, Auguary, and Noctover. And then there's one month of 45 days: Jember. Jember only has 45 days because winters are short where this calendar is used. Each week now has 8 days. The last week of the year only has 5 days (6 on leap years), and that time is used as a massive holiday with lots of celebrations.

That's an equally valid system for tracking our time.  

>and there haven't been 23425 years since the beginning of the common era.

Our new system is based on an oral history counting since the end of the last glacial maximum. Once again, our numbering of years is completely made up. I mean, in Iranian calendars it's the year 1396 or 1439. There have been [lots of calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars). Once again, all made up.

>Time exists since it can be measured, you're making a false claim. Changing the way we measure time does not mean that it does not exist. Do some research.

Time is completely relative to the observer. Even measuring the same event we can end up with different measurements for how long each event took depending on our speed. Time is an illusion created by our minds to process the ever changing and evolving entropy around us.

As you can see here:  
>Our paper shows that time doesn‚Äôt just exist ‚Äúout there‚Äù ticking away from past to future, but rather is an emergent property that depends on the observer‚Äôs ability to preserve information about experienced events. [source](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/09/26/the-arrow-of-time-its-all-in-our-heads)

>"In his papers on relativity, Einstein showed that time was relative to the observer," says Lanza. "Our paper takes this one step further, arguing that the observer actually creates it." [source](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/arrow-of-time/#i-10190F11-A028-4592-8048-4D66467093EF)

>Oh, and it's just a comparison

What I was hinting at is that a broken clock could be right 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. times a day, depending on how we decide (once again, completely arbitrarily) to track the day. And what if you're using a 24h clock? Then that clock is only right once a day.  posted to submission: Pok√©mon Switch to be revealed soon (THIS MONTH!!)

He has completely abandoned any pretense of being a reporter, or professionalism, or anything of the sort, and went full pro wrestling, soap opera nonsense. Its hilarious in the vein of Idiocracy in real life. Its even funnier(also sad) when you realize he has a huge audience that takes him 100% seriously. 

He's an incredible ham. Shit like this describes what I find most funny about him, along with the screaming paroxysms of hatred he goes into. 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdEINFmMn4M


Its like hes acting out a Bollywood science fiction novel or something, 80's robocopesque, cheesy but still endearing and skillful in how all-in it is. Its like his recent thing with Ben Shapiro, how he had some giant picture of Shapiros smug face as if he was Emmanuel Goldstein or something while he adopts some ridiculous Foghorn Leghorn affectation. Its so over the top its incredible.


I don't think I'm laughing with him, I certainly don't agree with his ludicrous views, and you can check my post history I'm pretty left for an American. If he is acting he deserves an Academy Award. I think its 70/30, like he sometimes realizes hes wrong he is but just went full method actor. 

You're not going to make me feel bad about laughing at a mentally ill person, lol. He makes millions and broadcasts himself.

[21:00:58] Comment: dz141dt by Merry_Dankmas : I can't blame you for this. My cousin is a fucking genius. He just knows everything and anything. Bring something up and he'll give you a fully in depth analysis about it along with sources and evidence to prove it. He's from Georgia (the US state, not country) and already had a southern accent to begin with. He moved to Alabama and developed a stronger accent while living there. He sounds like the biggest hick in the world but will blow anyone away with his intelligence and rationality. People outside of the south tend to believe he's some dumb hillbilly who fucks his sisters and smokes meth. I can't blame you for wanting to ditch the accent.  posted to submission: What did you learn as a child that took the longest to unlearn as you got older?

I'm not sure which teams will want to chase, with a lot of the favorites being on GC-teams that will want to save energy for more important stages later on. Lotto-fix-all may do it but how well does the finish suit Wellens?

I wouldn't be surprised to see a few repeat offenders from today, Sanchez and Montaguti and Pantano for example, Barbin as well to get some mileage back on Frapporti. Jose Goncalves would be great, but he's quite high in GC so probably someone else from Katusha. posted to submission: [Predictions Thread] Giro d'Italia Stage 11: Assisi ‚Ä∫ Osimo (156km)

The difference is that California is essentially a country by itself. People want to move here because of the state's international image of laid-back lifestyles, beaches, mountains, money, success, beautiful people, sunshine, etc. The same thing isn't exactly true for other states in the US. This is why I believe OP is "thinking of" California without proper consideration as to why they'd like to move here, and if moving here would actually allow them to achieve that reality. posted to submission: Thinking of moving to california from ireland

[21:05:10] Comment: dz14azr by if0rg0t48 : grapes (vitis vinifera) are a bitch to spray, often they are grown on rather sharp slopes and you need to ensure you get adequate coverage of a trellised vine which can be hard.  Spraying chemicals that are only topically active require smaller droplet size and higher pressure spraying.

I would certainly agree with that at this point in time.  I am also inclined to believe  Rae is no longer a factor for today's ONDP, despite it's ocassional proffering.     

Well much of our pollution problems will resolve themselves in the next few decades as renewables supplant FF's almost totally and transportation and heating becomes electrified.  That will be a global phenomenon, with little care for NA denier politics.

"So they're fighting to move the border from here -> | | <- to here!" (paraphrased).

Three things. One, Gaza and the West Bank are separate entities, and Gazans own Gaza; there's not a single Israeli, soldier or otherwise, that has been there permanently since 2005. In addition, the borders were completely open until fairly recently (1999) and in other periods (2005-2007). So what's happening in Gaza and what's happening in the West Bank are two separate things.

Second, with regards to the West Bank, it's a lot more complicated. You have entire Muslim-Arab cities in Israel (e.g., Tayibe, Shu'fat, etc), and entire Jewish cities in the West Bank (notably Ariel and Ma'ale Adumim). Previous peace proposals have included resettlement deals and exchanges of Muslim-Arab cities that consider themselves or associate with "Palestine" (outwardly, that is), and those that are predominantly Jewish (Ariel, Ma'ale Adumim), and those have been historically and recently rejected by Arafat and successors. In addition, you have the Israeli Arabs themselves that on one hand scream for Palestinian independence but on the other hand would never want to be included in such a deal. Why would they? They enjoy the most rights in the Arab world, low taxes, do not have to serve in the Israeli army, and have working and travel opportunities as Israelis that they would possibly give up as Palestinians.

Third, the border is a huge security concern. Israel stops a huge amount of attempts, during the 2nd Intifada it was something like 97-98% of infiltrations from the West Bank were caught, and there were still dozens of suicide bombers and other events. Not to mention the thousands of tunnels in and out of Gaza where tens of thousands of rockets are stockpiled and used to shoot at Israel every couple of years. The national toll road in Israel, Highway 6, sits about 40 meters from the border with West Bank (at Qalqiliya and again near Tulkarm. Google Maps Street View is quite informative on this). The distance between this border and Kfar Sabah, on the edge of the Tel Aviv-Yafo metro, is less than 2 miles. That's a 30-minute walk.

I would imagine that a large part of the decisions taken on the West Bank, then, relate to security moreso than to a "land grab". Israel is tiny, sure, but there's no reason why they'd squander away resources, lives, etc on a few miles of land (which would make it by far the most expensive land in the world by expenses). The government is not dumb. They're spending a LOT less making the desert a blooming place (not cheap, but much much cheaper). Open YOUR eyes, man, it's really not rocket science! posted to submission: White House: Palestinian Deaths at Gaza Border Are a ‚ÄòPropaganda Attempt‚Äô

[21:09:52] Comment: dz14qyj by redcirclebirdpicnic : I grew up in one of the more fundamentalist Christian sects.  Maybe 10 years ago or so I was dealing with crippling depression and my family got it in their minds that I was possessed.  Not in a Hollywood horror way but more as in engaged in spiritual warfare.  I‚Äôll try and make this short but while working with various people who‚Äôs ministries involved confronting spirits and breaking generational curses the name Ashtaroth came up and there were later synchronicities and confirmations.  Asteroth (as I came to know the spirit later) presented itself as female to me.  In any case, I remember several instances of spirits (probably just Asteroth but I have no way of knowing) manifesting themselves VERY aggressively during this time frame.  It certainly didn‚Äôt feel like this spirit was any sort of guide and more like it was trying to siphon off fear or something.  This is all super vague I know but I‚Äôm on a mobile and could fill up pages about the specifics.  Just thought I would share my experience as you seem to be pretty casual about invoking a demon.

[21:11:10] Comment: dz14qz9 by outis_and_polyphemus : Good call on the suit, especially for an MBA program. How you appear is the first thing someone notices about you. It's not the *last* thing, but it gets things started with the impression of being put together, professional, and prepared. 

I'll add that following up with the interview team is a great idea. You can address a simple email to the chair of the interview/admissions team, copying the others. Doesn't have to be long and certainly don't send it off immediately, but dropping them a line to let them know you appreciated their time is a great help. It's especially good if you can -- tactfully -- reference things you all discussed in the interview and then -- again, tactfully -- re-articulate in brief your commitment not only to the degree program (for the personal and professional reasons ThatUnoriginalGuy mentioned), but also to *THIS* MBA program over, say, SMU's, TCU's, UNT's, and any number of other schools. Like employers, University programs want to see not only that a person is attracted to (and adept at) this sort of work, but that they are attracted to the place as well. 

Good luck! posted to submission: I have an interview tomorrow to attend for my MBA. I had a few questions if someone could help me out.

[21:11:53] Comment: dz14qzi by Trixxster103 : I had a malware scare a year and a half ago (entirely my own dumbass fault), and I almost lost all of my files, because I didn't have anything backed up at the time. Even since then I've been extremely careful and cautious and notice even small changes like the font, in concern about malware. I also have two backups of everything now too, so if I had to nuke my laptop for whatever reason it wouldn't be a big deal. 

I didn't get my identity stolen last time, thankfully, and I still pirate shit, so I haven't let the scare take over my life, but I'm always extra cautious now. I triple scan every file I download, I have three malware softwares that I run once a month, and I'm even more careful where I go and what I click on. When I eventually get a new laptop one day, I'm wiping my old one and setting it up as a fresh laptop with only malwarebytes, spybot, and bittorrent and am going to use that exclusively for piracy and thus will have less to worry about. 

So yeah, that's what it is, just my normal cautiousness and paranoia ramped up to 11 because I'm in a foreign country and using a lot of public, open wifi spots.  posted to submission: Search Bar bolding switched around - Malware or just benign?

[21:12:42] Comment: dz14r0a by thedjotaku : Well, dude, not sure if you're still looking at replies, but here's my comment - reverse sear is over-rated. Best, most amazing steaks I've made on both my Kettle and Spirit are as follows (spirit instructions):

1. Get your Spirit super hot - all burners on hot for 15 minutes. 

2. Put a ribeye steak (1.5" more or less) on the direct heat

3. Close that lid.

4. Wait 1.5 minutes then rotate that sucker 45 degrees. Close that lid.

5. Wait 1.5 minutes, then flip that steak. Close that lid.

6. Do step 4 again.

7. Take that steak to the table and enjoy a super delicious steak.

Reverse sear has caused me nothing but grief. Last time I tried RS my wife said it looked like steamed beef. The method above always yield awesome steaks and as long as you clean your flavor bars, no flare-ups. Give me a medium steak with little to no grey banding.

[21:12:51] Comment: dz1524p by Portifinabelle : *Almost* every day. Really, the exceptions are when one of us is extremely sick or when we are apart. 

I‚Äôm honestly not sure, that‚Äôs just the way it has always been for us. It dropped off a bit when I gained a lot of weight 4 or so years back due to PCOS and poor habits, but when I leaned out, built an ass, had my B.A., and started taking care of myself, my confidence increased tenfold and our sex life just became fiery again. We lift together, so we‚Äôre kind of playful in the gym and tease one another (he‚Äôll pinch my ass when walking by, I‚Äôll do Romanian deads in front of him, etc) until we can‚Äôt wait to get home and tear each other‚Äôs clothes off.  

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll eventually change once kids come into the picture and sex becomes *literally** impossible at times, but it is an important part of our relationship and I know we will set aside time to do it - even if that means closing and locking the door to have ‚Äúmommy and daddy‚Äù time when the kids are no longer helpless infants. 

I think we just both have high libidos, and the gym / clean eating both help with the chemical aspect of that as well. Everyone is different though, as long as you and your partner match up, that‚Äôs all that truly matters.  posted to submission: Men who married their first sexual partner: How satisfied are you, and how often do you crave other women?

[21:13:38] Comment: dz15256 by kaczuszencja : If by damage you mean toxicity to brain manifested by lessions,imflamation and whole this scary shit then i can tell you that most gabaergics are very safe if not safest (not including alcohol ofc but even alcohol mostly damages brain when withdrawing).

But if you stop them abruptly after long time with long doses you can damage yourself very bad.

PAWS is totally different thing because there is obviously neuroadaptation to drug and some changs can be kinda permanent because chemistry of your brain changed.And this citation is obviously wrong because there is PAWS after for example dopamine agonists where there is no glutamate excitocity.
PAWS is probably some kind of supersensitivity of some systems in brain- not manifestation of neurological damage.

Same PAWS after SSRIs, there is no toxicity but there is metabolic and chemical shift in the brain, kinda like with finasterid.

10g or 60g per day for a year will fuck you up, probably destroy your liver etc but no one forces you to take such ammounts and its not done accidentally.People die from paracetamol and OTC painkillers all the time (liver damage,GI bleeding,strokes etc), no one givesa fuck if they take too many pills because adults should care for themselves.

Are they genuinely in love? They probably think they are. 

Your ex and her new GF are frankly not your business anymore. Remove them from your social media feeds so you don't have to see what she's up to 24/7, quit stalking her facebook/instagram/whatever, leave her to get on with her life, and look around you at your University.

It's even worse than that.  The insurance companies are effectively killing private practice.  When you only make about $35/pt, as a GP,  it's become clear the foxes are running the hen house.

Worse still treatment is being dictated by insurance.  They may give a prior auth, but it won't matter, because they will ignore it.  The patients and doctors are getting fucked.

Hospitals are run by bean counters and every doctor is disposable and just another piece of equipment.

[21:16:02] Comment: dz1526v by libwitch : You may still get calls, but in most colleges students like what Laimbrane is describing would not get special supports or services.  My guess is that most of them were essentially an IEP stand-in - the parents had dragged the poor kid to enough dr/specialists/psychs etc to "document a need" for supports she really no longer needed.

Colleges tend to require entire rounds of re-testing -- you just can't walk in with the same documentation you had.  And the supports they provide will be much fewer, with the emphasis of much of the pressure being on the student to work them out.  And the parents can not force the kid to use them.  The student will have to request them for every class; assuming they even bother to register as needing them anyway. 

Which means that kids that have parents that have been gaming a system like this end up in college kind of screwed. They may know they really don't need help, and never try to get it, or may not be eligible for it at all, but also have been left without the basic study skills to survive without.

I‚Äôm not concerned that he will ever cheat or leave, I guess I just am uncomfortable with the idea of him having the same thoughts I did.

[21:18:34] Comment: dz159z5 by Hyndis : You're still limited by hardpoints. Ballistic hardpoints are few and far between. It is not possible to spam AC2's even if they cost zero weight. 

Even the Victor 9S only has 3 ballistic hardpoints. Thats a maximum of 75 damage from 3 AC2's if you were to load up on them, and that damage is spread out. The spread out damage means its going to struggle to penetrate any armor.

Only perhaps the JagerMech could make use of lightweight AC's, but even it is limited to 4 at most.

Meanwhile very nearly every mech and its mother has more than 4 energy hardpoints. Energy hardpoints are common. Missile hardpoints are also very common. Ballistic hardpoints are rare. Forcing the choice between using what is effectively just a heavy machine gun (AC2) to do piddly damage at long range over random portions of armor, or instead loading up on an AC20 for some short range punch, is an interesting decision. The severely limited number of ballistic hardpoints means you can do one or the other, not both. posted to submission: Is the AC2 a joke? Are long range direct fire weapons a joke?

[21:19:03] Comment: dz159zj by CoachKoranGodwin : > If you watch consistently, you'll notice they start quarters and time outs off in a motion combo of some sort and then the players give up on the plays. You'll note who the two players in particular are who always have the ball in their hand when the play breaks.

I'd actually argue that this isn't the fault of the players who have the ball but the players who aren't on the ball. There are certain guys who don't move enough off the ball or create enough action for others through screens or cuts. 

Gortat's screens and Wall's driving ability are the only things that save the Wizard's halfcourt offense. Wall has shown in the playoffs that he has the ability to create an insane amount of looks for his teammates. What he lacks is a consistent shot under the rim or from the perimeter, but he needs to use these tools anyway to create for his teammates. 

It's the teammates and their inability to adapt or facilitate his play that are holding the team back. Beal, Porter, and Oubre all disappear when they don't have the ball. Only Gortat creates any action in the halfcourt. That is due to the reasons you stated imo: over-reliance on athleticism and a lack of bball IQ. I don't know if you can coach out of that.

You could argue that Wall stands still too much on offense when he doesn't have the ball, but he is so active and effective when he has the ball that I will excuse that.  posted to submission: Only Westbrook is less efficient than Wall (0.95pts per possession) when it comes to high volume isolation players. He needs to pass more, play off the ball better.

Ooof, yeah, that will make a large difference with carrying weight. You can definitely get total pack weights low enough for frameless packs, but that's reasonably deep into /r/ultralight territory. For the average backpacker, a well adjusted, framed back that transfers weight to a hip belt will make a huge difference. posted to submission: Weekly /r/CampingandHiking noob question thread - Ask any and all 'noob' questions you may have here - May 14, 2018

[21:20:05] Comment: dz15hii by Kelvin505dot928 : It's not about SJWs, it's about surviving politically. The UNI party does not care about abortions,guns,gay marrige.

When was the last time the GOP put a serious effort into passing something pro-gun on a federal level? With the current trend with the current demographics, in 25 years most states will have constitutional carry.

I say demographics because like Californians, the Latinos will continue to vote for communist leaning Democrats the way Californians vote for Californian policies in red states such as Montana and Texas. These Venezuelans who're heading for the USA will most likely vote for a communist after watching their friends consume the local zoo's animals to survive.

So these Uniparty representatives need to give amnesty to 20 million illegals. The Latinos may be hard workers but they cost so much money that if you were to deport all them in California, you could balance the budget after you've eliminated income taxes. Once you give them amnesty they will cost the state even more money becuse no longer would their imigration status block them from receiving benefits.

If you want to fix the immigration system then we'll need to end the Fed. If the government was restricted in the amount it could spend then it wouldn't allow migrants to send the "gold" to their relatives because there would be a limited amount of "gold" in the country. posted to submission: I hear that if you were to keep the legal & refugee immigration rate at the current rate, and were to deport all of the illegal migrants in California..

[21:20:33] Comment: dz15hip by delocx : It really depends on what the question is.

A lot of the questions out there have been asked literally thousands of times and there are literally thousands of copies of the same answer. Asking a single person directly is unlikely to yield as much detail or depth as Googling the answer and reading a couple more organized sources. I'm sure it isn't so much people are unwilling to help, it is just that the best help is to look up the comprehensive guides that already exist!

Of course, questions that aren't really suited to a Google search like "what is the weapon in this screenshot" are probably going to always be easier to have answered directly. posted to submission: I wish people asked other people questions more.

Esp for people with 0 or very small numbers of R5 armors.  With rehash of towers every month, and ranking events constantly, everyone will soon have 3-6 armors in no time IMO.  Not having more/early on will put you at a disadvantage in rankings...

Saving 20% to get one sooner is worth it early on, especially if you missed out on previous guild ranking events or towers offering a free R4 one.

I got both Silica's and Lisbeth's armor and I have literally 0 ranking Silica's and 1 Lisbeth.

The Pito armor won't give you the bonus +2%, but it still gives you +410 Atk to any female character...

However, you should stop short of your last statement. I won't be watching. I agree that stability is important and understand why OWL is doing what they're doing, but I just have no interest in watching a game that is no longer similar to the one I play. Even with a small segment tuning off because of this, I think OWL will be fine though with their viewership.  posted to submission: An update on Overwatch League Stage 4

If you turn it off, there is no way to get that ability back, so you're kind of playing a less-capable Mercy with it off.

Meanwhile, with it on, you can still fly to someone you're not healing; just stop healing, start flying, turn 180 and start healing the original target again. posted to submission: Mercy beam- Toggle option on or off?

correct title II helped solidify the monopolies is the point im making Title II took de facvto monopolies and gave them legal creedence to stop other ISP's  by forcing them to apply as utilities. so the other ISP then stopped trying to move into territories already controlled by existing ISP's now i realize i am using anecdotal evidence here but while i worked for RCN we  had vast plans to move into  4 states quite fast had al the plans laid out, then Title II was adopted and it froze all plans as we suddenly had to contend with the existing ISP's in territories, now covered as utilities. posted to submission: The free and open Internet has allowed independent breweries to thrive, and made home brewing more accessible to huge numbers of people.

[21:25:49] Comment: dz15uv5 by tartanbornandred : You've given two opinions here that I cannot stand, but have seen a number of times since Mourinho was first touted as a manager for us.

Firstly that it's too risky to play youngsters when we are not performing.

For me this boils down to what our aspirations are. And in my opinion United's aspirations should always been to have consistent success while playing exciting football, with home grown players at the core of the squad, complimented by signing the best in the world.

Once we have our aspirations set, we need to look at how we get there. And I don't believe you get there by saying it's too important to get back to winning to risk unproven players. For one, if we were competing for the title and the CL, then the same argument would then be used that every game is too important in the title race/CL to risk unproven players. And two, having a core of home grown players has repeatedly been demonstrated to be an instrumental part of all of our success, and the successes of other consistently dominant sides (Busby, Fergie, Pep's Barca, Liverpool through their dominance, Heynkes' Bayern, etc.)

You cannot just turn on an academy tap and expect it to supply world class players every season. But when we have made playing academy players a priority, we have been rewarded over time, as have other clubs. But it only works when trusting unproven, academy players is part of what you do.

We shouldn't look at giving academy players a chance as a luxury, or something that we have had success in spite of, when the evidence shows that giving academy players a chance has been an integral part of our club whenever we have had success.

The second opinion you gave that I hate is that the class of '92 may be impossible to replicate.

The Busby babes were also impossible to replicate. Until Fergie did it. Barca and Bayern have had their own 'Golden Generations' in modern football that have been dominant. After the class of '92 we still had a core of academy players linking one of Ferguson's great sides to the next.

The only thing that will make the class of '92 impossible to replicate it ceasing to give the required opportunities to our academy players.

Greatness is built from the bottom up. If we half ass our foundations we can only expect half assed success. The first step to getting United back to were we should be is to start behaving how we aspire to behave. posted to submission: I am quite surprised about this subreddit's opinion on our academy

People who don't own phones and people who don't own smart phones are in the same category - the 32% non-adopter category. Of those kids, seniors, and non-adopters I mentioned above, some will have feature phones, not nothing.  

- 8 people don't have phones (almost certainly the children)
- 24 people have feature phones (the younger teens, elders, non-adopters)

http://www.the107degree.com/single-post/2018/05/13/Timestamps-of-the-911-Call-Transcripts-and-Correction-Re-Witness-A%E2%80%99s-Route

From what I can tell, and to summarize, Cold N Holefield reminds us that Karen McNamara remembers being passed by SUV001 shortly after the Basch Ful Salon on Swiftwater/Goose Lane. Cecil has said he went down Swiftwater/Goose Lane and then left on Sawyer Hill Rd, right on 112. CNH then uses some math to show that 001 would have been driving exceedingly fast in order to pass KM 1st just after the Basch Ful Salon, and then 2nd at Goose Lane and 112, in fact, right about 100 to 110 mph. Driving that fast on those roads at night to respond to a car off the road is not logical, and may not have even been physically possible given the vehicle's limits. This leads to the conclusion that Cecil could not have been in SUV001, and that SUV001 most likely did not take the same route as Cecil said he did. At least this is how I understand that side of the argument, I'm open to corrections.

Then there's Maggie, who in one of the latest MMM podcasts (#75 I believe) says that Cecil, driving SUV001, would have been driving exceedingly fast, like 70 or 75mph, and that's why he passed Karen McNamara twice. She does not give an explanation as to why, or go into any math equations, and she repeats her disdain toward using math equations as a tool in this case. posted to submission: Timestamps on Faith Westman and Butch Atwood's calls

States that have laws establishing a framework may require that framework to actually be implemented by their state's gaming commission.

Maybe I'm fucked up for that, but I really don't feel overly guilty. I also don't feel like I am doing this because I'm sour about her choosing him over me (however I'll admit I could have a blind spot to this about myself). My conscience is telling me that I'm considering doing this because I don't think people should get away with acting like she has.

It would simply have been much better to just comment on how you would have done things (and even what you may not have done such as taking cervical films) without actually going so far as to say he‚Äôs a ‚Äòfraud‚Äô or whatever term you used.

You and I have both been in practice long enough to know you can‚Äôt always take what a patient tells you as painting a totally accurate portrait of what transpired with another chiropractor.

Did the patient mark on his history that his neck pain / upper extremity numbness was a secondary area of concern? 
Did the patient mention anything in his history suggesting his neck and lower back symptoms started at the same time, or could be related in any way? 
Can a cervical problem ever cause lower back issues? 

I‚Äôm not even suggesting any of the above was the case. I‚Äôm merely suggesting jumping to telling a patient his chiropractor is a fraud doesn‚Äôt help any of us look good in the eyes of the public.  posted to submission: I was able to obtain a complete copy of all my back/spine x rays!

You'll have to go with the old "trial and error" method, or seek men out in places you don't usually search in.

I'd add that watching porn doesn't necessarily mean the men will suck in bed... but for you to make this post I'll assume you've had enough bad experiences to draw from.

If you can't find anyone, try a guy who doesn't watch it as frequently as most. It might be more viable. posted to submission: Is there a place for porn free dating?

[21:29:43] Comment: dz165lk by OkSetting0 : I wouldn't feel so bad if our ownership/ front office had any track record or experience. It's such a Cincinnati thing to hire the good ol' boys instead of hiring the best of the best. Our director of baseball operations is an investment banker related to an owner. There is zero accountability in this town.

I wish the MLB had the power to punish shitty owners. I would love for a wealthy group of baseball people from out of town to buy the Reds. Instead we get local business guys who made their money in completely different industries. It wouldn't matter except that they all think they understand baseball and try to get involved in decision making. They hire yes men who won't question them either. 

Recent owners:

Louis Nipper - P and G heir. Didn't know baseball but was good a owner because he was hands off. Reds were successful under him. 

The Williams' - Made there money in insurance. 

Marge Schott - Born into a wealthy family and married a successful car dealership owner. Used that money to buy ownership in the team when her husband died. Constantly bitched about paying black people to sit on their asses. Let her dogs run around and shit all over the stadium and embrassed the city with her racism.

Carl Lindner- Made his money in insurance. Thought he knew baseball.

Castellini - Made his money selling fruits and veggies. Thinks he knows baseball.

[21:29:51] Comment: dz165lm by Kecha_Wacha : The Dark Lord Ravvin Erlend was born to a lesser noble family across the ocean from Symirrha, exiled along with his family for his father's alleged crimes. They were put in a boat and made to sail west until they died. His father did, but Ravvin and his mother reached the shores of Hematite where his mother died shortly after. Ravvin was found and adopted by the House of Sutherland with aspirations of overthrowing the ruling monarchy.

For twenty years Ravvin obsessed over scant memories of his homeland, stories from his dying mother of towers that pierced the skies, great iron snakes that wound through cities of glass, carrying thousands of people on their backs to faraway places. He contrasted this with Symirrha and its normalcy, their primitive technology supported in large part by magic, and he decided he could do better than King Egil if he took over the kingdom.

He created the persona of the Dark Lord, a hated warmonger who would murder the royal family and rule Symirrha for several miserable years until the people were ready to give up hope entirely.

Then he would switch characters and portray the rebel hero Edmund Salbrossa, a mighty pyromancer who would rally Symirrha into fighting back once again, leading a siege up to the Dark Lord's palace. Edmund and "Ravvin" would do battle for hours, laying waste to the palace until at last the Dark Lord would falter and die, leaving a power vacuum with no surviving royals to filll.

Edmund would step up to take the empty throne, and lead Symirrha into a golden age and a utopian future. At least that was the plan, but Ravvin never managed to exterminate the royal family and he was ultimately defeated by them. He died full of regret that all of his war crimes were for nothing.  posted to submission: Long Knives and Broken Glass: Tell Me About Your World‚Äôs Rise of Evil

[21:29:53] Comment: dz165ly by Asdrubael_Vect : In canon my warden was a male elf arcane blood mage who personally execute Loghain(and all his & Howe supporters with antivan crow quests and later he execute all antivan crows in ferelden) and kill Archdemon to become Arl and commander of Amarantine

He without any doubt(especially by purely strategic points of such) send Chantry with Templars to hell and supported mages

He try to hide Andraste Tomb existence from Orlais Chantry(even defile ashes, execute Genevity with Lelianna and kill entire cult after drinking dragon blood), he do a blood magic ritual to kill orlais supporter Isolde and save Connor from demon and Isolde-Orlais influence

He support Zathrian with dalish and kill every werewolf and prevent any blighted werewolfs existence in ferelden

He support Blehen with Branka so he have their promised maximum support as biggest army of dwarfs and especially golems for grey wardens and he does help legion of dead to have more power

He let Avernus do blood mages experiments for grey wardens sake

So he does not have any other solutions to not loosing what he was done and put another grey warden as Alistair ALONE on throne and he does not meet his "sister" so my grey warden as grey wardens order have more influence on him

He done for his personal power and grey wardens interests and that loghain situation or wardens exile would never happen again, and that Ferelden was not become another Orlais or friends of Orlais and its Orlais Chantry

[21:30:34] Comment: dz165mk by cerberus17 : This is so beyond frustrating. At this point, Trump truly believes he is above the law and who can blame him? We‚Äôre a year and a half into this shitshow and he is committing crimes faster than they can be investigated. What‚Äôs the point of having a Mueller investigation if it‚Äôs going to take 4+ years to complete? Trump will (hopefully) lose the 2020 election and so much damage will have already been done.

Even if Mueller‚Äôs investigation finishes sooner than that, there‚Äôs no telling what‚Äôs going to happen. Unfortunately, I think the most Mueller will do is provide a damning report and turn the process over to Congress (ie, no indictments). From there, Congress will do nothing. Even if Democrats take both chambers, they won‚Äôt get 2/3 the Senate for conviction.

Despite every new report, every new crime, every new piece of evidence that makes me scream ‚ÄúTHAT HAS TO BE THE NAIL IN HIS COFFIN‚Äù, nothing happens. Just more disbelief from the media, more complaints from Democratic members of Congress who hold zero power, more justification or, at best, ‚Äúdisappointment‚Äù from Republicans. Yet, no actions from Congress. No reprocussions for Trump. All that has happened recently is he has SOLIDIFIED support from Republicans in Congress and his approval ratings have GONE UP. It seems Trump and his actions are not ‚Äúbecoming normalized‚Äù...they already are.

I weep for our future. posted to submission: Schiff: Trump deal with ZTE a ‚Äòviolation of the emoluments clause

My Zorah Magdaros build is using Royal Burst Gunlance, the Guild Cross Beta Armor for Great Luck, Heavy Artillery gems, Artillery Gems, and Magazine for Capacity Up. I would clear all 3 cores as fast as possible, ignore Neg, and just Full Burst the last dead core until forced to the final phase.

[21:34:17] Comment: dz16glw by TheBagelFucker : You are completely right. I think knowing what items to buy when is one of my main obstacles to improving and I am working on it. I'm going to try diversify when I get vanguard aswell as getting aquila more. I guess when I don't go vanguard I will prioritise the 5HP regen talent at level 10, even if it becomes obsolete when I get heart it will still really help me early.

I skipped vanguard for hood a few games back when I was facing a zeus and OD and it worked pretty well. I think the regen is even better than vanguard so it doubled up as I was forced to jungle a lot.

Thank you for the advice, I really appreciate it. posted to submission: How do you build spectre?

Not mind-cleaned mutant only designed to wage war with only a few backstories possible, while stormcast can be everything : male, female, noble, commoner, king, lumberjack or priest, violent or peaceful, with childs and family. 

They can wage war, but are useful too in times of peace, building and directing cities. They know fear, too, and can be reasonnable (sometime even making a truce with chaos or understanting why people joined it)

And the fact they loose a part of their humanity (to, at the end, loosing fragment of memories and identities, to the point that, at one point, a stormcast failed to remenber his best friend) make them more tragic and likeable. posted to submission: Who would win? Sigmarine vs Space Marine in melee

[21:36:03] Comment: dz16gnh by CliffP : It's semantic but saying unchanging variable is nonsense is still wrong though. 


Ice cream is defined as frozen and cold. But you can have hot ice cream. 

Just because the existence of something is usually defined as "x" doesn't mean you can't use an adjective. 

Variable as a noun means the **ability** to be changed.  If you have something that *can* change but hasn't over its existence, it is an unchanged/ing variable. 

If the entire program is "double x = 5" and nothing else, then you have a variable that *could* be changed but it isn't and won't be.  posted to submission: Kerr: Draymond can remember every plays that happened too. I don't think it's that rare

Musculature - Free fitness. Easy, done. Id go for an athletic build, toned abs, built shoulders and arms, fit legs. Nothing excessive, as i don't really like the look of overly muscled guys.
(+1 Familiar)

Hyperfertility - Taking it on the large balls and excess cum. However Being totally fertile i feel might backfire in my face with all the baby pixies running around. Might start to take a whole lotta effort to keep them satisfied unless i release them to go do normal faory things with other fairies.
(+1 Familiar)

Always Hard - While it could be considered a drawback, due to the potential inconvenience, I choose to see it as a positive, as this means two things, one, erections are never uncomfortable due to either longevity or other factors, amd two, you're always ready to fuck.
(+1 Familiar)

Double dick - Twice the fun. While im not specifically interested in having two cocks, it DOES bring certain oppritunities to the table. Namely having two pixies being stretched out at the same time. It also begs the question do you get double the pleasure when you're using both of them at once?

[21:37:59] Comment: dz16ml6 by Skyx10 : When I watch Anime or read manga and compare them with other mediums in animation or comics, the former just tends to have a wide scope of topics that are introduced.  We have a fuck ton of sports anime/manga that range from American Football to fucking water polo, there are a lot of historical stories being told too, one of my favorites being Vinland Saga not just story wise but the quality of how it's drawn, and many others just seem bonkers compared to other comics or animation such as Death Note, Fooly Cooly, Gurren Lagann, Trigun, the list goes on.  Many of these go on to get animation adaptations and become massive.  

I want to find good stories that is easy to ingest and not too difficult to get into and manga is my first source to scratch that itch.  I've tried reading Marvel comics, even got a subscription, and was recommended some comics to read yet I got bored of it fairly quick.  One thing that manga tends to have as an advantage is their consistency.  When you read Spider\-man or Iron\-man comics you will never have the same drawing quality especially when it's within the same universe.  Naruto has changed but as it got more popular artists found their sweet spot and stayed the same.  I wanted to read all of Annihilation and there were many heroes that have their own stories that I later found out didn't need to be read to finish Annihilation.  It wasn't very consistent in my book.

Superhero comics aren't bad but a problem I see is that because of Marvel and DC other comics tend to be overshadowed.  Marvel and DC sell very well, not as good as it once was but eh you get the picture, making other genres a little more difficult to come by.  That's where manga fills that gap for me.  American comics can have good comics but the scope is just so narrow and leaves a vacuum of genres out in the shade where as manga just keeps pumping out stories bad or marvelous yet those stories still, at the very least, might have me glancing at them.  posted to submission: why do you watch anime?

[21:38:42] Comment: dz16rhv by Lhun : It is 10600 pixels over 20 inches, (no really) generally speaking. we have a limited number of rods and cones and a lot less blue ones. (that's why things look blue at night usually) our red receptors are much better then blue in terms of fidelity, and we're a lot more sensitive to changes in intensity. 

a pixel spacing of 0.3 arc-minutes will basically match the eye. 

Each pixel must appear no larger than 0.3 arc-minute. Consider a 20 x 13.3-inch print viewed at 20 inches. The Print subtends an angle of 53 x 35.3 degrees, thus requiring 53*60/.3 = 10600 x 35*60/.3 = 7000 pixels, for a total of ~74 megapixels to show detail at the limits of human visual acuity. (at that distance). 

It's very doable. A 27 inch 4k monitor viewed at a relitive distance will be higher resolution then your eye can see, and up super close and behind a lens, like it vr, that changes the  value significantly. We also only have a small visual accuity in the centre of our vision that operates between 77 (slow) and 240 cycles/sec depending on ambient light and how alert you are. posted to submission: The cosplay that looks way better than the actual game.
[21:38:43] Comment: dz16rhu by metoothanks__ : what you said about attention is so true!

I was also raised by yellers and I refuse to yell at anyone lol and i dont allow people to yell at me, I will NOT tolerate it and I simply tell them to talk to me in a calm matter or i'll walk away. it's a huge boundary for me. 

And yea my parents were the type that made a huge deal if I ever spilled something or broke something so now as an adult I feel incredibly guilty anytime I do something like that even though it really isn't a big deal.

After them we're reliant on Fosu-Mensah, Borthwick-Jackson, Pereira, Johnson, or Tuanzebe getting in the squad to maintain to record. Or Mourinho promoting someone.

Far from impossible.

Also, the only "hack" I see in the video is removing textures on his own device, which wouldn't affect anyone else. The rest of the hacks referenced in dialogue aren't actually seen in gameplay, so they probably don't work/exist, which is a pretty common tactic used to gain subscribers.

[21:40:45] Comment: dz16uwe by The_Chiselnator : Yeah. You are a loser. But like mental illness, once a crazy guy says "By God I am batshit crazy" he is on the way to being cured.

You are a loser but you are better than 99% of losers because you know you are one. So you know what you don't want to do.

So you make 28k but have no assets. If you have no assets it means that you have very few costs (assets have running costs). So where the fuck is your money going? How much are you paying per month for the debt?

But money problems are not the disease here. They are a symptom.  You don't have structure in your life and it doesn't sound like your father is helping you develop one.

So what you must do is develop a plan to increase your income and get out of debt.

How?

You might find the answer while lifting. I am not joking. Lift. See what happens. Get off internet, lift a bit, read a lot (Jordan Peterson is good fo you as you are exactly the kind of young man he talks to)


You already know the way. You just need to declutter your life and see it more clearly

[21:40:48] Comment: dz16uwi by kerkyjerky : I am guessing but I think necropotance is very rare in kitchen table magic. Kitchen table magic as the vast majority of players understand it is a deck builders tool kit, a pre con deck, some packs from various sets, and eventually another Precon deck that matches their color and they jam together with the old one.

When they escalate they normally go to easily understandable yet cheap cards. Then other players effectively answer this new dominance or they come online asking for advice. That is when they really see how easy it is to upgrade your deck and entire strategy quickly and efficiently. They do this and the previously dominating player now needs to escalate again. Eventually it can get to channel and necro, but I think in terms of timelines I would guess it takes at least a standard rotation for that to happen. posted to submission: What's your unpopular magic opinion?

So 2TB is $20, or twice the price. 

Where it gets economical is at 5 users, where they advertise ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù storage. That‚Äôs $50/mo. Which you could easily go in on with your friends.

[21:45:23] Comment: dz17822 by Conrad_effin_Verner : ...seriously?  What‚Äôs your problem, man?

I‚Äôm not particularly eloquent, to be fair, but my point was that *in addition* to the heroes you mentioned, there are heroes that really don‚Äôt have to do hardly anything to get POTG, making Ana POTGs even harder to get.

Pharah and Genji actually require a moderate amount of skill to get multi-kills with their ults, whereas Junkrat usually doesn‚Äôt.

You were saying something that came across as ‚Äúlol wow you suck if you‚Äôve played Ana for so long and haven‚Äôt gotten POTG as her yet‚Äù and I was attempting to elaborate on why that it‚Äôs actually really hard to get POTG as her.

[21:46:15] Comment: dz1782h by TrumpUberAlles : > Really dude you're saying they look like the reasonable ones.



Sorry, but they do look like the reasonable ones in this particular set of circumstances.

* Suspended missile and warhead testing

* Agreed to end Korean war

* Released prisoners

> Lmfao this sub would rather support a dictator than our president.


Not at all.  

I do wish we had a functioning diplomatic service and had some hopes of achieving something lasting and serious, but we have a narcissistic fool [who won't even prepare for the meeting](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/north-korea-summit-to-hinge-on-trump-kim-chemistry.html) and Kim knows that he is desperate for a win before the midterm elections.  What could possibly go wrong?

>Kim hasn't canceled the meeting in Singapore he's just doing this to make himself feel like he is in control even though he's not.

Getting a sitting U.S. president to meet with him is a tremendous propaganda victory for North Korea.  Who is really in control again?

> If Kim cancels Singapore it will be 10 times more embarrassing for Kim.

Not really, having military exercises right before the summit is a provocative action, and China and Russia already have plenty cover to ease up on the sanctions, and that is probably Kim's biggest immediate goal at the moment.      

If [Trump agrees to withdraw some part of the U.S. forces from South Korea as he has signalled](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/asia/trump-troops-south-korea.html), that's just icing on the cake for North Korea.   I'll be surprised if they don't get that and some amount of hard cash infusion in exchange for another one of those agreements like they signed for Bush in 1991 or Clinton in 1994. posted to submission: North Korea reportedly threatens to cancel summit

[21:46:51] Comment: dz17831 by JuichiXI : Great list and god job so far!

I agree with number 4, but I would also add a few things. For some people when you make the effort to exercise it sometimes helps motivate you to eat healthier too. The second thing is that building muscle will help you burn more calories. Thirdly and most importantly is that regardless of how many calories you are burning or muscle you may or may not be building getting exercise is a healthy habit and can make you feel better. For me I can really only go for walks. It's not going to help me much to lose weight, but I feel better and I can slowly feel myself getting stronger.  posted to submission: 30 days of CICO - Lost 11.2 pounds

[21:48:09] Comment: dz1784n by Olindoga : So what I always liked was the story angle. Have the main character be a grunt with plot armor (but not too much, fear for a character sometimes can drive a story just as hard as knowing that they will survive (RIP Tasha Yar)). 

So, have a mission where you see the chaos around him as he desperately fights for his life and the lives around him, and conclude that by having him in a briefing and listening to the other events that unfolded and have his reaction to them.

Conversely, you can have multiple main characters in different teams (I'd say no more than 3 or 4 teams so that your reader doesn't get confused) that let the reader be in the action more. The only problem with that is that you have to come up with unique problem solving for each group to express. For example: One group likes solving problems with explosives, another stealth, another face-checks, and the last one doesn't do anything without all the information (or whatever).

Its totally up to you how you drive your story. One of my favorite stories recently was Rebirth of the Sword and that was mostly exposition and down time with politics and other stupid shit noticeably getting in the way of actual work. Make it an action piece, an adventure piece, a political drama, whatever you want. As long as you're passionate about it, it'll come out in your writing.

---

So I read the other 5 stories. They were really good. The only thing I would say about them is that you need to stop going back and reiterating what you say in previous parts of the series. Just link to it and continue wherever it left off. 

From what I saw you have some real talent at writing. You only had 4 or 5 glaring errors in the 4 main works together that I saw at a glance and they really didn't detract from the story at all. I can see the progress you made (I actually remember reading the original posts a long while ago), you just need to keep at it. Writing isn't like riding a bike, where you never really forget how to do it. Its more like computer programming, where if you stop for a month and come back to it, you have no idea what you're doing.

If you want to finish the story/series idea and shoot me a message for me to look it over then I will gladly do that. Now that I have an understanding of your universe, the word document makes a little more sense but still needs to be fleshed out.

I look forward to seeing your work. Cheers posted to submission: [Meta] I really need an editor.

[21:48:25] Comment: dz17fme by parzivalsanorak : > I don't think waiting to have sex is the same thing as "using sex as a commodity".

I think that is a very valid point. I should clarify, however, that I don't equate those two. I'm not advocating jumping into bed with every sexy stranger you meet. There are absolutely valid reasons to wait regarding sex with a new person. I think however, that both having sex with someone and waiting should happen for the right reasons.

> Also, believe me, if "choose a better partner" were a viable solution we'd have all figured that out decades ago.

I think it is. It's just not easy to read and understand someone's true motives. The human condition is not something you, I, or anyone can figure out, IMO. Honestly, I think it's more useful to focus on the sex life one wants to have rather than being on the lookout for what to avoid. If I require honest communication, vulnerability and openness about sex, I think I'm cutting out most of the people who just want to fuck and are gone afterwards.

[21:48:31] Comment: dz17fmk by galactickevin : * Graduated from UNR in 2012 with a CSE degree. Working near full time at the Apple store which was great for college students, great flexibility with schedules. Typically went to school in the morning and went to work in the afternoon/evening/weekends.
* Got hired as a software engineer for 5 years, M\-F 40 hours a week. Typical desk job.
* After 5 years decided that my skills weren't that good anymore and I wanted a change in careers. Applied for the MBA program at UNR. \(fun fact: every single class for the MBA program is after 5pm as it is designed for working professionals\).
* Currently taking 1 to 2 classes every semester in the evening while working the same 40 hour work week.

To answer some of your questions: It wasn't too difficult to go back to school after taking a few years off; I was excited to get back in the class room. All of my credits were valid \(as it was only 5.5 years between my undergrad and grad programs\). Some of my MBA classes were waived because of my business minor. You can PM me if you want more details regarding my job, but in general, as long as schooling doesn't interfere with your work, most places would be thrilled to have an employee dedicated to self improvement.

In your initial reply you said,

As I pointed out he was convicted and sentenced while he was an MP in November of 1999. Ramsey didn't lose his seat until the 2000 election.

Here's another source.

> Ramsay was convicted of attempted rape in November, 1999, and sentenced to nine months in jail. But the verdict was overturned on appeal last January because of errors in the trial judge's charge to the jury.

After that he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.

[21:49:37] Comment: dz17fo2 by Bloodfeather6996 : Its not really so much that I worry about my legal situation. I've been to prison, so its not really a scary thing to me. Just a vacation from bills and stress with lots of boredom. I had to stop myself from stabbing someone with a buck knife yesterday over 100 dollars lol which isn't totally uncharacteristic of me from time to time, but I do worry about how meth makes me less conscious of my anger when it flares up. That's more of a struggle with my conscience though. 

Also, I don't really care about people knowing about me doing meth. I used to be a hardcore IV heroin addict, so people are actually likely a bit relieved if they hear that I'm only smoking meth these days. I've never been very capable of shame anyway, and I've always been an open book about most things, especially my addiction problems. However, I've always been prudent about personal hygiene and grooming, but meth has made almost to the point of being obsessive over it at times. Particularly when it comes to the removal of body hair. If I go longer than a day without a shower or even start to feel greasy, it makes me very anxious anymore. 

I live in Cincinnati, where as far as I know the entire drug culture revolves around the vicious cycle of trying to survive the balance between  fentanyl and narcan while staying as close to death as possible. I don't think there's much tweaker culture to speak of, and regardless, I do everything I can to avoid social contact of any kind. I don't really leave my house except to go to work, the laundromat, or Wal Mart, all of which are within two miles of home. I used to be a pronounced extrovert, but I've gone the complete opposite direction from a combination of three years of incarceration immediately followed by back to back codependent relationships that were somewhat similar to incarceration. The latter one was especially bad, but despite how freaking insane she is (not normal insane, like borderline schizo insane) or how much she hurt me, I still can't manage to get over her. Its closing in on a year that we've been apart and I haven't even attempted to make an advance at another woman. This is extremely atypical of me- I used to something of a man whore, to be honest. 

I stopped going to bars after the last relationship, partly because we did so much it got boring and partly because I do tend to get into fights when drunk in public. I was a bad alcoholic and I also hardly ever drink anymore. However, I do combine meth with weed whenever possible, and I recommend it to everyone who uses. It literally negates most of the bad side effects, most notably sleeplessness and loss of appetite. I started smoking a lot while high when I started to become underweight and I'm actually in the best shape in years now from eating plenty and working a shit ton of hours. Cutting alcohol out means no gut, either.  Also, the combined body high and the way weed kills any anxiety that comes with the meth high are very nice. As far as ROA goes, my preferred methlds are smoking and your favorite of the oral dose. I mainly oral dose when working long hours so I don't need to redose often, or when I just wanna get really fuckin high all at once lol. Smoking doesn't give me any trouble like a lot of people claim, even though I smoke the most hardcore way possible with a blow torch and a water piece. I guess its just because I started out doing it this way with my former plug, and the first few times I tried meth years ago was IV in combination with heroin. Fuck snorting the shit though. I burned a hole through the inside of my nostril doing that too much last year.

There's zero chance of me quitting cigs lol I've been a smoker since age 11, and my job involves selling people cigarettes all day. But like I said, I'm not too worried about anyone's opinion of me. I do keep up my appearance out of vanity, but its hard to look too clean cut when you have as much of your upper body covered in prison tattoos as I do. I also don't have any co workers besides my boss, who doesn't care what I do since I do the job of what would normally take 2 or 3 employees and he doesn't have to find anyone else he trusts, which is hard because he trusts like no one besides me. That also goes into the whole being reliable thing as well. I work 7 days a week, and haven't taken a day off (by choice, he's offered plenty of times but I declined for fear of boredom and less money) since Labor Day, which is around 260 days or so. I don't really have a landlord, either. I just live with someone that has a house he inherited. The way I came to know him is totally insane sounding to most people and entails a story all its own, but he's aware of my drug use and isn't exactly a shining example of clean and responsible living himself, anyway. Plus, I pay more than my fair share of the bills, so there isn't much he can say about it. I somehow have incidentally gotten myself into a position in life where I really don't have to impress anyone very much. I haven't talked to anyone in my family in years, and the few friends I maintain a relationship with all do drugs of some sort, or at least have known me long enough to know they should worry more if I ever stop doing drugs altogether. I guess there's the customers at work, but I have pretty well mastered the customer service persona to the point that its second nature, and the majority of our customers are either drunk buying more alcohol or about to be drunk. People buying alcohol don't tend to care about the sobriety of the person selling it to them as long as it doesn't interfere with them getting un-sober. Plus, my boss could give two shits about being nice to customers, and is actually notoriously temperamental when it comes to customers. I've seen him kick out and ban countless people for as little as using a tone of voice he didn't like, and have heard him threaten to pull a few out of their cars and beat their ass lol sorry about the book of a response just to get to this, but I guess my main concern is that its getting increasingly difficult to keep finding new dealers. I've literally been through like 5 or 6 now. And I got spoiled by having dealers that either would hook me up to a ridiculous degree like my good friend that was my sole connect until he got popped in January (yeah the other 5 dealers have been just since January), who would just down a gram for me, him, and his cousin when we would come thru and then sell me an 8 ball that weighed 5 grams for half of what he charged regular customers. And the few after him at least would deliver straight to my house which was also very nice. Plus, the way things have been happening has left me with a very eerie feeling that I can't shake. It would seem like I've been witnessing dealer after dealer get systematically taken down from an outside perspective that stays true to the stranger than fiction nature my life has always had. My friends always say that there's a cloud that follows me everywhere raining chaos around me, and that it would make a good book except no one would believe half of it. And for a while the ice was starting to have a negative impact on my mental health where sleep deprivation was causing delusions so life like that I'm still not entirely sure some of them weren't actually reality. But there's other people not on meth that have beared witness to this vacariously through me to validate that there is indeed some real fuckery going on. Also that its too insanely coincedental to even be in a movie the way that I keep stumbling by happenstance further and further into the whole charade. Solely in the pursuit of getting high in just a few months, I've blindly stumbled into what I've determined to be three seperate but intertwining storylines that span three cities in two states and have accounted for at least 6 busts ranging from small time peddlers to the guys just below the cartel. The strangest of these storylines is one I've only just learned about through news articles and an old friend that was dealing with the characters from it. The story was strange to begin with, being about a guy I went to school with taking the police on a twenty some odd mile high speed  chase before wrecking and being discovered as a large player in the local drug trade. But the updated story that came out yesterday revealed that the pretext to the car chase was the guy being beaten unconcious and robbed. Then upon regaining consciousness he went looking for the guy that robbed him, broke into a camper that is apparently inhabited by the former friend and current enemy of mine with whom I caught my prison case back when I was 18, and held him at gunpoint. When he realised the robber was no longer there, he let my former codefendant go, who then immediately called the cops on him. There also little details given by the article and the old friend that had dealt with him that inexplicably tie him to the other two storylines at play here. 

Sorry again for the length of this, and if none of the little narrative I went off on a tangent about made sense. I'm sure it probably sounds like the ravings of a mad man, but I thought I really was just delusional again until reassured by multiple people that I really am living out some fucked up Tarantino meets Scorcese drama. It feels like an episode, or really a whole season, of Shameless, Trailer Park Boys, and Breaking Bad all rolled into one too dramatized for real life white trash thriller. posted to submission: Thinking of kicking my meth habit once this last bit I have left is gone.

[21:50:27] Comment: dz17fop by Lacy_Drays : I'd say there's two types of female heroes. 

First I want to say \- There might also be men who need saving by women \- as they might have had abusive/enabling/narcissistic mothers \- which in turn makes the guy a people\-pleaser or something like that, whom some other girls or the mother herself might continuously be exploiting. 

Then a sane woman hero steps in, shows the guy he deserves to be loved and appreciated unconditionally, without all the people\-pleaser\-gestures. And that woman that will not exploit him. And that woman will be there for the guy to support him finally autonomously realize his potential. 

Now \- I don't think this sort of a woman can be a young girl straight out from home. It might be a woman who has seen some shit and struggled trough. 

Here's the longer story I wanted to tell:

Overthrowing tyranny, finding a father in religion if there are no good men or role\-models around, realizing your own human potential by stumbling, falling, failing and for god knows what reason coming back up again; surviving despite the odds and growing up into a spectacular human being that will be useful to herself and then later useful to those around her \(much like for men, BUT\). 

How do you know you love someone if you literally depend on them or if they hold it in their interest that your view of yourself and the world is flawed enough for it to not seem more interesting than your partner. That's something I noticed in the "red pill sex strategy" community \- some of these guys seem to PREFER their women dumber and with as little experience as possible, as they do not like being intimidated or confronted at all. 

And for men here at this point \- JP has brought up the Medusa, and how men are terrified of women \- and how that is not really something to run away to Pleasure Island TM from. They are the boys of Neverland. 

And guess what \- it takes a whole lot of courage from a woman to stand those guys up \- many women just get brainfucked and remain with the bottom feeders, as they are completely unaware of their options \- they can't even think to explore, they don't even dare to think perhaps their Mr Neverland is a sort of a tyrant!

And these women enable tyrants like this to become, and these tyrants extort girls who may have had bad fathers before them. And these sorts of people end up getting kids and giving them a very bad example of "how to human". 

Imagine most people from such broken houses who have not yet matured seek companionship for some sort of validation, narcissism and all that \- and oh boy how misleading and exploitable that sort of a person is! 

I've heard of this mindset before, "He/she wants to fuck me, I must be pretty/smart enough then!"

So, all of that above, and there, here's your female hero \- a someone that would have been stoned to death in certain cultures \- for when you only know men that are tyrants or otherwise with some sort of a deep inferiority complex, it's, the way I see it, very natural to become a bitter little bitch like some of those 4th wave feminists come off as. 

But consider this too is just a phase, a dark episode in these heroines' journeys. 

I bet they don't trust men because they have bad experience with them \- to them a man who will be their hero to liberate them simply cannot exist \- psychologically speaking shit like confirmation bias and cognitive bias do not help the case \- they believe they have been proven right plenty of times \- so at some point, maybe they are considering themselves a hero, they take it upon themselves to push trough life, depressed and childless and bitter, at least for a while, as the flood comes, information keeps pushing in \- and over time you know, some even break trough with what comes trough. 

They slay the corrupted dragon within, they fix themselves up and become some of the most compassionate and critically\-kind women you've ever known. That sort of a woman will then, seeing the bright new world in a more optimistic way, also open her heart to a male hero if you will, and creating a family even. 

And I think we're going to need people with this kind of experience and knowledge to not go back to some dark ages where disoriented people got stoned by others, where making a honest mistake cost you your life, where having a broken home or background before you was a certain death. So, I'm just saying don't start stoning SJWs to death just yet \- people who know better shouldn't get agitated at them, but they should hold the ground and not change the laws just because someone so irritatingly demands it! Not saying you should be nice to them either \- not at all. You be how you need to be. 

Just saying they are, in a way, on a heroine's journey, as well. Some adventures just are longer and more complicated than others :\) posted to submission: Women have hierarchies. ‚ÄòTaming the beast‚Äô myth not sufficient.

The BGS is meant primarily to simulate a living universe that responds to players' actions. All players actions, not just the ones that play in open. Its not meant for PvP competition, even though it can be used for that as well. To restrict the BGS to open would go against what it's meant to accomplish, which is at its core to allow the universe to change in accordance with player activity. I would hope that Fdev wouldn't cave on that point, but with enough people demanding it and being able to point to PP as a supporting case, who knows. 

And CGs and CZs, which are also being demanded from people both here and on the FDev forums.

If you live in Canada, for example, you can purchase an exchange voucher for the pass from the official [Japan Rail Pass Canada website](https://japanrailpass.ca/).


The difference between the two sites listed on the wiki is not explained because there shouldn't be any difference, aside from and possible shipping or exchange rates. The price of the pass itself is does not change, and I would be wary of any sites offering you a "discount".


If you are unsure about which site to use, I would encourage you to contact your [nearest regional office of the Japan National Tourism Organization](https://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/contact/regional_offices.html). They should be able to suggest which site would be best for you to use.

Wargs have their own unique powers that I don't believe can be taught, but I'm not certain you're born with it either. The Children of the Forest seem to be immortal of some sort. Aside from her dragons, Daenerys is immune to fire. Arya learns the ability to change faces through the power of another obscure god. There are many more examples but all with different origins and some vastly more powerful than others. Martin gets away with it by mostly keeping the origins of the 'magic' vague.  posted to submission: Is more than 2 magic system too many?

[21:51:51] Comment: dz17lnt by Spud2599 : Your stat's are wrong. The average salary of cops is well above the median salaries for teachers you posted above. If you were looking at SDPD salaries for Police Office I, note that is the entry level position for graduates from the academy. They would be eligible for movement to PO II after a year or so where the salary escalates beyond teachers in a hurry. Couple in Overtime, special assignment pay, uniform allowance, etc etc, and you typical cop makes far more than the average teacher. I'm not suggesting that cops should get paid less, but lets not skew facts. Also, most teachers work far more than just the 40 hours a week that they're paid. 

The crisis in hiring officers is a complicated issue. Unions want you to believe it's money driven. It's not. Public perception of law enforcement is a much larger driver as to why people don't want to be cops in the first place. In the 70's/80's lots of cop shows that showed fun, excitement and taking crooks off the street. Then Rodney King happened. Right or wrong, suddenly the "glamour" of policing was under fire. Add to that video after video of police incidents where (rightly or wrongly) the police are made to look bad, why would anyone get into that career anymore?  Ask any HR person the numbers of candidates in the 90's compared to now...it's staggering how low it is...and it's not a money issue either.  posted to submission: Homeless/vagrant and SDPD repsonse

[21:52:16] Comment: dz17loc by Ragnatronik : There's a billion speaker and headphone threads with great info already. Speakers are a way bigger investment as the general rule is to invest at least as much money in your acoustic treatment as you do your speakers, otherwise you're wasting your money on the speakers. Whereas with headphones you don't need any treatment, and $300+ pair from reputable studio headphone manufacturers will be adequate for decent mixes above subbass. You will need speakers at some point in the process to check subbass. But since you have no idea and are probably nowhere near the point of needing that type of detail, yeah some M50Xs should do ya fine combined with those beats to check consumer style playback.

[21:52:48] Comment: dz17lov by cmykstrings : That's really tough.  It would be a difficult set of expectations for a lot of men to adhere to but I understand where you are coming from.  

I sort of look at it another way, this man I have at home, he had porn when he was young, he found dirty magazines in the bushes, downloaded messed up .gifs bit by bit on a dialup modem, and all of that, was a private thing for him, before he ever knew me.  He has had a longer relationship with masturbation and porn than he has known me.  I feel like, what he does and how he does it is his business.  I don't ask or see the material because it's about turning him on in private, nothing to do with me.  Do the girls probably look super different?  Sure.  Is some of it maybe more hardcore than I'd ever want to experience?  Maybe.  It doesn't really mean anything.  I feel like what he does with porn is barely significant, because it's not causing any impact to our time together, we have a healthy sex life, he is appreciative of me and I feel attractive and nurtured sexually.  

I don't share my clipping toenails or digging out boogers with him.  He also doesn't get updates on my bowel movements.  Those are just private kind of things nobody really shares because they are kind of private, gross, personal, unnecessary for anyone else.  So if he looks at porn, it has nothing to do with me.  

I can understand that because of the history you don't want that around you, but that need creates an issue of compatibility.  He tried to modify his behaviour and failed.  If you can't give, and he can't change, options are limited.  

Does it have to matter?  Do you have to correlate the behaviour with respect or love for you?  Or can it just be that you get it's something he needs and though you don't love it, as long as he respectfully keeps things discreet, you don't really pay attention or mind?  I'm not criticizing just asking questions to promote exploration of thought and considering other possibilities.  

Deal breakers only exist because we decide an issue is more of a problem than our spouse is worth tolerating.  posted to submission: Having trouble trusting again, dont want to divorce
[21:52:49] Comment: dz17low by baltyjane : > He can't eat without having a beer, even at home.

I love beer, but this is not normal. He has a real problem. You're making it about him not taking turns being the designated driver but that problem isn't going to go away unless you address the larger issue. He's got a problem with alcohol. If he literally can't eat without having a drink, he's never going to give you a turn to relax and have a few. You've got to address this. And for god's sake, don't let him drive your kids after he's been drinking. Even if the suburbs Uber exists. 

>  But he would never allow a cab. 

You should be the one not allowing your children to get in the car with parents who have been drinking.

> He would refuse to leave our cars anywhere.

Too bad for him. Order an Uber, put your kids in it and leave his ass then. You're enabling him to put the rest of you in danger. He needs help. If he's not going to get it, you can't allow this shit. posted to submission: Me [34F) with my husband (35M) of 6 years, I always have to be the designated driver and the sober one and it unfair.
[21:52:51] Comment: dz17lox by death12236 : Nope. It's because the record label that they used would only release heavy metal prior to releasing Nickleback, and this was back when music lovers would buy albums based off of the record labels (for genre)

[21:53:04] Comment: dz17lp5 by drifterramirez : How can you make that claim? Saying that those that do choose to disclose generally do so within 1-5 years has no bearing on the actual number of disclosures vs the number of abused. You're saying that people who experience abuse are more likely to disclose it than hide it?

Now I'm thinking that this isn't really unrealistic, but also the likelihood of people disclosing goes down drastically after a certain age/period of time. Kids may not appreciate the significance of what has happened, whereas if someone gets older and fully appreciates the magnitude of what happened to them, they may then push that wayyyyyy down.  posted to submission: Almost 1,500 Migrant Children Placed in Homes by the U.S. Government Went Missing Last Year

There's a reason you get a canned response, it's because an individual answer to everybody would take too long. Some offices will tailor the boilerplate to address specific issues the constituent brings up. And it's not just interns, LCs and LAs do this too. Senators will have the information flow upward to them, and if they're good at their job, will have a good idea of how their constituency feels about a topic.

In short, they're not just sending you a canned response, they take notes and report up the chain too.  posted to submission: I know you‚Äôre tired of hearing about net neutrality. I‚Äôm tired of writing about it. But the Senate is about to vote, and it‚Äôs time to pay attention

So Hitler's definition was 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws

To me, but I am pretty ignorant on this, it seems different from

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return

> By the way, I didn‚Äôt say Jewdas is using Hitler‚Äôs definition; I said Corbyn is.

My bad. I'd say Corbyn uses Jew for those that call themselves Jew. By and large. I've never seen him argue that 1/4 a jew wasn't a jew. Or something like that. 

> Those are the Jews Corbyn chose as his fig leaf. You‚Äôd think he‚Äôd go to a mainstream synagogue or traditional Seder to actually meet the people he claims he doesn‚Äôt hate.

[21:56:20] Comment: dz17ssv by MLGBlatter : Went into normal school as a freshman in highschool.

My Advice:

Studying/School Work:

I had a really hard time in my 9/10/11th grade years with studying and homework. My mother gave us a great education, but there is a lot to learn about the process of academia. I'm not sure what it looked like in your situation, but it was really hard for me to learn how to 1) sit in class, 2) do homework in the demanded time-frame and 3) figure out a regime of studying and actually sitting down to do the work.

Your teachers are there for you and will most likely be really open to helping you fit in and foster good habits. Just try and figure out what you're good at and where you need to imporve and then lean on your teachers/guidance counselor for help. Some teachers are dickheads, but most love a kid seeking learning. 

Most people can fake it through high-school with basic reading skills and understandings, but if you want to go further, you've got to put the work in. I say this because I'm a smart person and I totally self-destructed during my freshman year of college and dropped out, wasting a whole bunch of money and time because I didn't learn how to apply myself in highschool. 

Social Stuff:

Being a teenager is a weird time for all of us. I've been out of highschool for so long that I don't think much of the practical advice would apply. ("Message the cute girls on AIM after school while you and your buddies download Rage Against the Machine rips off Limewire." lol) 

That said, go by the old school rules. Be a friend, make a friend. The best way to make friends later in life (or if you're starting from zero) is to treat your new friends like you've known them forever. Help out, be an encouragement, be the kind of person that you'd want to have in your life. 

Go out and have fun, get your heart broken. Learn what you like and find people to stay up until 3 in the morning doing it with. Make people laugh, cultivate a real desire to be compassionate and kind. Don't let the lies that assholes tell define you. Be your own person, figure out what your passions are. Just remember that the lasting things you'll get from these next few years, aren't going to define you in the next twenty.

Also don't drink and drive. Or ever take any drugs from a person you don't know.  posted to submission: Any other homeschooled ex-Christians out there?

Rey has that kind of feeling with Kylo but like after a few days, then she decides she is going to just plop into the whole fleet and try to save him, she shouldn't be invested that much into a guy who may have had a lot of issues but also straight up murdered quite a bit of the resistance and Han Solo.

Yeah, you shouldn't say "100% sure" just in case, but I'd say it's pretty likely, especially since there's nothing *that* powerful about her. posted to submission: Genealogy units demotion

[21:58:15] Comment: dz17zst by Sinclairlim : Disclaimer: This is just my opinion/experience.

> is Ritalin still widely prescribed with all the other stuff out there? 

As far as I know, yes. It is the go\-to drug for ADHD where I live. \(Aguascalientes, M√©xico\)

> What is the likelihood of having a massive heart attack? 

Very low. Especially at such a low dose: 20mg is nothing. You can start being concerned when you are at 60mg.Also: certainly lower than the likelyhood of losing your life to a dumb mistake caused by your lack of focus, such as a car accident.

> Are you able to eat? 

Able? yes, with very little difficulty. But when you can finally focus on something, and at the same time you stop feeling hungry because Ritalin suppreses your apetite, you often forget to eat. Keep that in mind.

> Do you have a crash in the afternoon that makes you irritable and want to punch someone? 

Only when I forgot to take my Ritalin for a day or two.

> Do you grind your teeth? 

Nope. I was actually less anxious when I took Ritalin.

> how long should I give it if I don't like the side effects?  

2 or 3 months. Some of the side effects will go away. You will also get used to others.

> What should I be aware of? 

1. Don't forget to eat.
2. If you don't eat well, you might get gastritis.
3. Be very careful when mixing it coffee.
4. If you want to drink alcohol on any given day, do it 5\-6 hours after you take your Ritalin, or your liver will pay.
5. Find a system to keep track of whether you've taken your pill any given day or not. Taking twice the dose is going to be... unplesant.
6. The first weeks you're likely to feel dizzy and disoriented; this is normal. Don't drive.

What you're saying is like saying Joe Thornton is dirtier than Raffi Torres because Thornton speared a guy or two when all Torres did was take guys heads off their shoulders on "hockey plays".

Oh and routine plays turn into something more all the time. A routine check led to Fowler's injury. Wasn't dirty. It was a play that happens tons of times during a game, it just happened at the exact right angle and time to cause an injury. Just like the slash from Crosby.

[22:02:58] Comment: dz18dyv by blurbusters : Excellent to see you're on the ball on this.

Some monitors support Large Vertical Total tricks (e.g. 1/144sec scanout at 60Hz for certain 144Hz monitors) -- we use this for other reasons like reducing strobe crosstalk.  But the same trick is used by HDMI Quick Frame Transport, too.

Even in an undocumented way, using a custom resolution utility, I am able to manually-create a form of HDMI Quick Frame Transport (even on DisplayPort or DVI too) -- basically transmitting refresh cycles faster with longer blanking interval pauses in between them.   

Many of my gaming monitors supports this, and it reduces input lag (of games that flip framebuffers at the end of VBI .... most Direct3D Present() APIs seem to flip at beginning of VBI which does not help reduce input lag on Quick Frame Transport).     

The Direct3D Present() API should perhaps eventually have a minor modification (a special flag) to allow framebuffer flip nearer the end of VBI -- preferably after all the porches (Front Porch, Sync and Back Porch) but right before Scan Line #1.  To allow adaptative input delay mechanisms to better adapt to Quick-Frame-Transport mechanisms better. posted to submission: No 120hz with 1440p on AOC AG271QX monitor with Xbox One X.

[22:03:02] Comment: dz18dyx by munchbunny : It really depends on your build and playstyle. I use sensor lock enough to put it on 1-2 of my mechwarriors.

Early game, it's really useful for stripping evasion from fast light/medium mechs. Your pilots aren't skilled up yet and you don't have +accuracy weapons lying around. If your hit chance starts at under 50%, it often makes more sense to sensor lock them instead of taking pot shots.

Late game, heavy and assault mechs move much slower, so you can often park yourself over a ridge and use sensor lock to take pot shots with your LRM boats to wear them down while they try to close distance. I find that highly effective because you can often kill one before the manage to get into visual range. posted to submission: Sensor Lock: how do I use it ?

Here is the problem, she wasn't associated with the Foundation, at all, during any time she was in politics.  She didn't take a salary, she wasn't on the board, she was not affiliated with it.  Her daughter has been basically running it for at least 10 years if not more.

[22:03:53] Comment: dz18dzl by ToughConversation : DFS = domain frequency switching                 
The channels are semi-reserved for things like radio stations. If the AP detects a sanctioned use, you'll be switched to another channel. There's often a little lag associated with searched when you first power up an AP. In practice... eh, I know people living next to a ton of radio towers who have never had any issues. Most consumer routers do NOT support DFS channels so in practice they end up WIDE open. 0 interference from the neighbors.                       


You WANT to use an unoccupied channel whenever you can. That's the ideal. 

If you use 20mhz channels on 2.4GHz, channel 1 will "bleed" into channel 3. Channel 6 will span 4-8. Channel 11 will span 9-13. If you choose channel 3 for example, you'll operate between channels 1-6 and basically you'll get interference from EVERYONE. They'll also get interference from you.

[22:05:19] Comment: dz18e0k by ecnei : Less fake spends also happen from churn. If all users churn several times for every real tx then forever-unspent outputs start to approach 50%. If they only do 1 churn then it approaches 75% as more users do so. What is real amount of churn? Who knows. Probably not more than 5-10% of outputs? It is more than just intentional churn though ... people moving to new wallets or people emptying one wallet to deposit all on an exchange also count.

You are right that an exchange monitoring all its users for example 2 exchanges colluding to see which clients are the same on both exchanges has some uncertainty unless there is a repeat then the certainty goes right back up.

Scenario I am talking about:
Simplest example: Attacker sends money to multiple merchants to see which merchants are actually the same. 

Or: I have a Monero wallet and I buy servers using 2 different wallets. Then I join the leftover Monero from each wallet, with or without some churn in-between.

Or: I withdraw from an exchange to my wallet. Then someone sends me monero to that same wallet, suspecting it is me. 

For many users trying to hide from LE it is not enough to have probable deniability it is important to be truly hidden in a large AS probably over 1000 users [0.1% chance of being true]. Even if a join has a 50% chance of being real that is serious evidence for LE to look into. Thus this depends on the user threat model but I think for many users trying to launder BTC via XMR joins should be viewed as highly toxic and avoided.

...plus we are not even taking into account that LE is likely to be able to get tx info from big exchanges... ShapeShift alone would give them 10% more-or-less of outputs further reducing ring effectivity. posted to submission: Why privacy by default matters: Zcash private tx susceptible to analysis heuristics

[22:06:43] Comment: dz18mj1 by gothpunkboy89 : Just leads to the game stagnating earlier as no new mobs or bosses can be created. PvE and PvP both will grind to a halt. PvE quickly because no new bosses or mobs means players get bored and PvP slowly because eventually it stagnates.  Not liking the update is understandable but paying to play a reskinned version of the game complete with same fundamental flaws that restrict and inhibit growth without jumping threw increasingly odd hoops I will never understand. With the unintended side effect that has the other game's mods trying to make it like OSRS thus creating a hybrid of the two systems in a way that instead of the best of both worlds it is the worst of both worlds as they try to please both groups.


But enough nostalgia

They are no more loud then any other individual for the "new" additions. They have their loud moments and their quiet moments. You can cherry pick them just as much as the original.

[22:08:27] Comment: dz18mke by CaptainPain : I never said it was noble, but when it comes to defending themselves, they get to choose how. If hamas knows that Israel is going to use live bullets on them and civilians if they rush the border, and they rush the border, well I think we should place blame where it's due. If they want to play the pity card by getting their own people killed that's fine, but they still got their own people killed. It's working. The world is up in arms about Israelis actions so in that sense hamas was victorious. There are some people who recognize their actions for what they are though. A suicidal border rush to show how evil Israel is. They have been playing the victim for years while simultaneously launching rockets and mortars into Israel. They are aggressive towards Israel and they have every right to defend the lives of their citizens. What would have happened if they didn't stop the border rush? That's the question people should be asking. We know their intent because they have told us. posted to submission: Nothing says ‚Äòpeace‚Äô like 58 dead Palestinians

In my case, my wife had a friend who was a shrink who diagnosed my wife wish dementia within an hour (I was convinced she was suffering from profound depression).

It must be frustrating for you and your dad cannot get her even to a new GP. Would it be possible for him to take the presumably long journey to visit her old doctor, or is that trip just too far?

I guess it's the wrong season for a flu shot, so I guess you can't use that as an excuse to get her in -- although you might be able to try to use that as a reason to bring her in to a doctor to give her an initial evaluation.

[22:09:23] Comment: dz18ml2 by baspeysp : Because we have fix-bug-updates like High Sierra which introduced more bugs, and iOS 11 is obviously rushed.

[22:09:24] Comment: dz18ml8 by annoyingcatSM : Peanut isn't very loving to tarot, and I have a theory about what will possibly happen to peanut and everyone *if* Rick decides to go anywhere with Karishad's love life.

1. Peanut and grape go out (they have discussed doing this before)

2. Max goes out with someone else, (maybe sahsa or another thot)

3. Karishad talks to tarot about how he feels

4. The relationships shift to Max x Thot, Peanut x Grape, and Karishad x Tarot.

[22:09:56] Comment: dz18vhk by IndyRevolution : I really wished they had kept this, would make a fitting end.

Odin was essentially a pirate raider who spent his life as a murderous marauder and raised his daughter to be the same, then had a change of heart and when his daughter couldn't cope he locked her away and sent a legion to murder her, and when the legion was summarily slaughtered he covered up all mention of Hela or his past whatsoever.

Then he raised his legitimate son to be a cocky, violent manchild and neglected to tell his adopted son what he really was while also raising him in the shadow of Thor, ensuring Loki grew up hating his brother.

And all this time, he sat back on stolen goods and prospered.

For all his good moments, he ultimately should have died as a hobo. It was what he deserved. posted to submission: Worst Faked Locations.

I was really looking forward to more of that, and I don't know just didn't get it in BP. I'm not a terribly big fan of action and I like the MCU movies cause of the character moments but there are a few scenes in a few movies which I find to be really cool and it's almost always these types of scenes where there is weight to the CGI and gravity. The train scene at the end just seemed to floaty and flipping around in zero-g, and regardless of the quality of the CG that type of fight scene does nothing for me. posted to submission: Honest Trailers - Black Panther

[22:12:29] Comment: dz191t0 by justinm001 : No one should know how much other employees are being paid or clients are being charged.  Might be OK for a couple employees but when you have a bunch and one makes more than another nothing good comes from it.  Almost every company has a policy about not discussing pay or benefits for this exact reason. Its one thing to have a quarterly review and discuss the state of the business and its goals, its another to tell everyone everything and hope they don't get upset. 

Its only a labor law violation if we're paying hourly and having them work without being paid (paying for 40 hours and them physically working over 40 hours).  Salary we can have them work 100 hours as long as they're making over minimum wage for those 100 hours it's perfectly fine and legal.  

Double-billing isn't considered fraud or immoral as long as you're billing for reasonable services. If you're installing software and it takes 15 minutes to install, and you can do 10 at a time, its perfectly ethical to bill the client for 150 minutes even though it only took 15.  Because it takes 150 total minutes to complete the job.  posted to submission: MSP owners, What would you pay someone with the following responsibilities/experience?

[22:12:50] Comment: dz191tc by BohemiaButtMan : I've written extensive writeups of the teams (check my post history).

But I keep coming back to Sirloins, Blowfish, and Beewolves

Sirloins - Great power. Good speed. Mediocre but not terrible Defense. Good velocity based SP and RP. Good substitute C. They have no glaring weakness. They have respectable speed AND defense. And very good SP and Power. It's a rare combination. 

Compared to the "speed" teams, their defense and pitching is miles better. Compared to Moose/Wideloads power teams, their speed is much better. 

Blowfish - only glaring weakness is RP, which is the least 'value' stat since games are only 5 innings online. Very good speed. Great contact. Good SP. Very good to good defense. Respectable but not great C.

Beewolves - Defense and speed are very good. They have 5 base stealers which is more than enough. Pretty good SP. Studs at 2B and SS. Good 3B and LF defensive subs.

I don't think stepping away from using the same colours every season is wrong as long as each tier or rank at least has a noticably better reward which I don't think these banners did really well.

> Then the goal explosions, diamond and champ having the same explosions not to mention grand champ

They are extra so I don't really mind them not having one for each rank. I mean grand champs already get 2 specific items so I don't think one more common item as a problem, be happy you get an extra item in the first place.

> Finally, you cap the whole post off with another soft skill reset announcement, when the majority's been clamoring for a hard reset for months on end

I've not seen anyone wanting another hard reset, I for sure don't want one as it fucks up everyone that isn't in the higher ranks. It may make people climb easier who are good but it makes the people fall when they aren't.  posted to submission: Competitive Season 7 Rewards Preview and Season 8 Details

[22:16:05] Comment: dz19a53 by jakl277 : They immense issues with water quality and availability 

here are some more stats on pollution about CA!

According to the American Lung Association's recent "State of the Air 2017" report, California is a leader in air pollution among other states, with the highest ozone levels.[10] The top three cities in the country with the highest recorded levels of ozone (smog) levels were Lost Angeles-Long Beach, Bakersfield, and Fresno-Madera.[10] Salinas, California is only city of California that reports no days of unhealthy air quality. While the air quality in California is significantly better in northern California, more than ninety percent of Californians live in counties with unhealthy air.

The reason they have low carbon per capita is because they have low energy demand per capita. They have "its total energy demand is second only to Texas," given that CA has more people we can thus conclude CA has a low energy demand per capita. EIA says this is because most CA persons aren't using heating/AC as the same rate as other people in the country.

[22:16:39] Comment: dz19a5x by coip : > Except that you defended the Danish study with numbers from the Danish study.

They're both Danish studies, they both have a large number of observations, and they both found circumcision to be harmful.

> So have you accepted that the Danish study has the flaws I identified.

No, absolutely  not. The study is superb. It's extremely rare obtaining population-level datasets, particularly ones that allow for a primary analysis on an N of 4 million and a sensitivity analysis of an N of 800 thousand. Again, using proxies are a completely valid analytical technique, and you've done nothing to prove that muslim in in Denmark are not circumcised and that their higher prevalence of urinary tract issues--again, which decades of extant research associates with male genital mutilation--is due to something other than the near universal rate of male genital mutilation among this sociodemographic group. 

> Here they are again: 

I've already addressed this fallacy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8gmzz4/circumcision_should_be_illegal_expert_claims/dytqi1d/) and again [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8gmzz4/circumcision_should_be_illegal_expert_claims/dz0jt59/). It is an invalid, intellectually dishonest argument that has no sway with me, so I do not understand why you keep regurgitating it other than that your only strategy at this point is the fallacy of argumentum ad nauseam, but I'll explain to you its idiocy again if you will: even if a surgery had zero risks (which isn't the case), that is *not* a justification for forcing it on non-consenting patients when it is medically unnecessary and indisputably harmful. 

And don't think I haven't noticed that you keep avoiding this question: " "To clarify, your argument is that any procedure can be done on a child that fulfills these asinine criteria is justifiable? Again, I ask you if that's your position because you continue to ignore the question of whether you support forced mastectomies and forced labiaplasties too (given their "medical benefits" and the fact that girls have a five-fold risk of UTIs compared to boys), right? Or are you a hypocrite?"

> A the plethora defense or .... as I've said before the Gish gallop

Decades of empirical research and established scientific theory is relevant and definitive; dismissing it simply because it undermines your crusade to mutilate the genitals of healthy children is unacceptable and telling. You are the Lord Voldemort in [The Unbearable Asymmetry of Bullshit](http://quillette.com/2016/02/15/the-unbearable-asymmetry-of-bullshit/).

> I see this a lot when debating antivaxxers and flat earthers. 

Red herring fallacy: poisoning the well. 

> let me be more precise. You have to specify in detail the evidence for your claim

I already did that by pointing out that the cherry-picked study in question is not a randomized control trial, is not a representative sample (meaning its results are not generalizable), and does not control for important confounding variables previously associated with iatrogenesis (e.g. forced retraction). 

> Following this same logic then 100% of the studies you've quoted are bad 

Whataboutism. It's also a straw-man fallacy. That's not what my comment stated. There are plenty of valid methods out there. For example, the Danish study in question was a population-based analysis, making it statistically representative and generalizable. 

> It meets all the criteria of the criteria for a large-scale, random sample 

No, it doesn't. Not at all. It was descriptive statistics of a biased population: "a cross-sectional study in one pediatric emergency department" with a tiny N of 393 boys who were not healthy, with categorization from a nurse into a questionable 3-point scale, and in which you are trying to claim that because intact boys in this biased, unrepresentative population had a higher rate of UTIs that this someone means that intact boys everywhere have higher rates of UTIs. This is the exception fallacy, and your conclusion is not supported by the literature.

> So? They also didn't control for the orbit of the moon.

So this is a damning ommission given that extant debunkings of methodologically flawed studies on circumcision and UTIs in the past revealed that the reason those flawed studies found higher rates of UTIs in intact boys was because [those UTIs were iatrogenic, literally caused by  improper intact care](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/). 

You're guilty of *onus probandi*--shifting the burden of proof. When one wants to advocate that healthy, functional, innervated, and erogenous tissue is permanently ablated from a non-consenting patient, the onus is on that person to provide indisputable proof of a consensus that said act is necessary, beneficial, not risky, and not harmful. All you've done is cherry-pick already debunked arguments with absurdly lopsided Needed-to-Harm rates, while completely ignoring the other parameters and completely ignoring the hypocrisy of your argument.

Again, you want to talk about the science behind this decision, start with explaining to me the functions of the body parts you're advocating be forcibly amputated from healthy kids and the negative consequences this has on sex, masturbation, and everyday life. posted to submission: Circumcision should be ILLEGAL: Expert claims public figures are too scared to call for a ban over fears they could be branded anti-Semitic or Islamophobic

For three years before that I was focusing on myself, my career, my hobbies, and creating my own path in life. I look at it as we kind of just crossed paths and have been heading in the same direction since then.  

I'm a bit younger than you (25/M) so I had more time and patience, but I gave up looking for a relationship a long time ago. Now I'm learning how to be in one again. People meet in their 50s and get married, so never give up, but you're going to wreck whatever self esteem you've build by *looking for* a relationship. I'm a believer that they just happen organically, and if they don't (online dating where you're essentially forcing yourself to date and talk to people you have no immediate connection with other than a few pictures), very few of them actually last anyways.  

Keep doing you and working on yourself and someone will come along eventually.

[22:19:04] Comment: dz19h0o by fabricwench : Simplest is to sew right across the strap at the top of the cup, making a loop of the extra strap length. Then hand sew a few stitches to hold the loop down against inside of the cup just through the lining. This way you won't have any raw edges to deal with and it's 100% reversible. 

Just so you know, that stitching is done by a coverstitch machine. It looks like sewing machine stitches on the front and serger stitching on the back. Super cool but not a super common home machine. :) posted to submission: Weekly r/sewing Simple Questions thread! - May 13, 2018

today its at 13.01$   ( lost out on 1375$)  .    
Lesson is unless you are a day trader . Sit on your hands and wait it out.  The shakes will come ... just sit tight.

[22:19:27] Comment: dz19h1m by angryglitter : I live in southern ontario and my closet is mostly black and I love my jeans so I feel you. 

There‚Äôs also the challenge of having an outfit versatile enough to handle the office A/C and the sweater shuffle that happens as a result. 

I have two words for you (or maybe one my phone doesn‚Äôt have spellcheck ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) - Maxi Dress. Maaaaaxi dress. Don‚Äôt tell men since they seem to think I dressed up when I wear one, but it‚Äôs basically like wearing outside pajamas. I like long jersey or cotton black dresses (yes even in summer, the sun can fight me) and I wear them all the time. If you suffer from thigh chaffing a maxi dress will hide shorts or leggings too. 

Not into dresses full stop?  Light weight jeans my dude. I personally get mine at uniqlo or h&m but these are looser styles like boyfriend or painter, they‚Äôre breezy and give me good sun protection. Plus the rips my vagrant ass insists on having isn‚Äôt bad breeze-wise. 

In terms of tops, I‚Äôm a big fan of gauzy vaguely see-through tops. I will wear a bandeau or similar underneath (I have a black lace band that covers, or can double as, a bra) and I‚Äôll rock that on hot weekend days with my jeans. I wear my doc martens in the summer but I get their sneaker brand for summer. I‚Äôll wear my boots though if the mood strikes me. I also have loafers, slip on sneakers, plain ballet flats, and mules for footwear options. All works. 

A looooot of people will tell you to wear linen but I hate hate hate linen. I am basically a sheet of paper and burn within 10 minutes and get heat stroke super easily but this all does the trick for me. I can happily exist outside wearing something I listed above.  But that being said, I hear linen is the jam for lots of folks so give it a try maybe? posted to submission: Am I the only one that sucks at dressing in the summer?

Carrier phase positioning from GPS has had cm level accuracy for years. 10m is worst case scenario and a borderline slur for the system. New civilian GPS signals will improve the urban canyon problem (not addressed by other GNSS systems). 

In the mean time GLONASS keeps failing to launch. Europe can't get satellites in the right orbital planes or keep their clocks stable, and China only cares about China and doesn't publish shit. 

You know it's okay for the US to do something good once in a while right?  posted to submission: TIL that the GPS service used globally is paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense, and costs upwards of a billion dollars annually.

Imagine he's a foot taller than you and 100 pounds heavier than you.  Imagine you know exactly as much about him as the woman you're approaching knows about you.

Now imagine he's approaching you with exactly the same intentions as you have towards this woman you're approaching. But you don't know what his intentions are - you only know as much about him as this woman knows about you.

How would you want him to proceed?

Now, some people's immediate response when reading this thought experiment is "But I'm not into men!"

[22:21:38] Comment: dz19m45 by pillbinge : I don't think you understand the premise.  We almost all agree that a person's content and character should matter the most.  What we're talking about otherwise is how content and character have been discarded by society at large, and that experience creates people.  Being colorblind is to fight ignorance with ignorance.  You can be ignorant or knowledgeable and still end up being right, but only people who are knowledgeable have control over that.

The alt-right already does profess a version of colorblindness.  Many people won't judge people by their skin and will instead rely on character, but they'll ignore what made these characters.  People who live in poverty experience many of the same hardships, but to pretend like there's not a disparity in race is to turn a blind eye.

I am going to guess this warped view is fed by examining the worst-case examples of people asserting they are SJWs, as provided to you by your chosen echo chamber of social media and news.

That said, in all fairness, many people do this about Democrats, liberals, Republicans, conservatives, libertarians, and even self-professed independents or moderates.

The point here is that there are many self-identifying SJWs who would support the above statement (or actively do), and many whose policy proposals and political activity embody the statement.

Whether it was Bernie, or Jill, or Dennis, or whoever, I think just about any other candidate put forward by the Democrats would have won, but instead they put forward Hillary because it was her destiny to be the first female President, or some stupid shit like that.

[22:23:43] Comment: dz19m5z by Knockemup : Racism is an aspect of some of our societal problems and not the cause of them. Acknowledging it occurs and ensuring everyone is treated equally until racist either die out or learn to not treat people differently because of their bias seems to be the method to go with. They tried separate but equal and you got jim crow. Showing that racist being allowed to run rampant with no safeguards will not work. They tried ignoring the problem and now you have woefully ignorant people who can't distinguish history from revisionism. Racism to some may be a perception to some but to other Americans who were simply born with a little bit more melanin, it is an often daily struggle with civility to people who hate you, judge you, or wish Ill upon you, instantly because of some perceived superiority complex.

[22:24:43] Comment: dz19tom by InternationalEdge6 : No. 

The court vacated two parts of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, determining that the FCC did not have the authority to impose these orders without classifying network providers as common carriers. Since the FCC had previously classified broadband providers as "information services" and not "telecommunications services," they could not be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.

At the time of OIO 2010, it was under Title I. OIO 2010 didn't change that. That was the problem. They tried to enforce NN without changing carrier status.

Stop pretending we had common carrier status the entire time, that defeats the purpose of the net neutrality fight. if we had it the entire time they're would be absolutely no reason for people to lobby for it in 2014. posted to submission: ‚ÄúDemocrats are increasing looking to make their support for net neutrality regulations a campaign issue in the midterm elections.‚Äù

[22:25:51] Comment: dz19tpc by pokitopockets : So this time they started with US promotions, so most shows will air in the middle of the night for you most likely.

This sub will have discussion posts for all their appearances and people will share tons of links to watch, so don't worry :) For the BBMAs, Mnet will air it as well, so there will probably be a high quality stream somewhere. We will have hosts talking over the show in korean, but if it doesn't air on TV there, it's probably the best stream you will get. For AMAs I used the sound of a crappy stream while I watched the Mnet stream. I don't know if it will happen again, but just posting the idea here lol

For the korean side, we will have even more content. There are weekly music shows and they will probably go to these shows for at least one week. The Mnet Comeback Show will be streamed on Youtube, so no problems there. For the others (Inkigayo, Music Bank, M!Countdown, Show Champion, The Show), we have to use online streams of the korean channels. But there are tons, so don't worry about it. Their performances will be uploaded to youtube as well, so even if you can't watch them real-time it's fine posted to submission: Love Yourself: Tear Observation

[22:26:46] Comment: dz19tpm by flying87 : At the end of the day, it sucks when you lose a war. It sucks when you lose wars repeatedly. The Palestinians will never win. They need to take a deal. Even if it's an unfavorable deal. Because the only thing they can hit Israel with is bad PR, and honestly that doesn't win anything in the ground. I garentee Israel has a game plan if the US abandons them. Which is very unlikely. 

You have understand that Israel doesn't believe it can just go back to Europe like a lot of bigots believe. They fight like their backs are against the wall. Because they know the world doesn't give a damn about them. Not really. So they fight like hell.  posted to submission: Palestinian protesters: 'Jerusalem is not Trump's city to give'

A lot of lower ranked players aren't able to fully capitalize on callouts anyway.  
  
also, while true there are plenty of times you can tell who the weakest link is, there is always something you can be doing better to help your team win. Unless you have half the team throwing or something there is something more you can be doing to maximize your chances of winning, however small they may be. posted to submission: My main account has been stuck in silver/gold since season 1.

Im not 'self promoting', I did a cool thing that I wanted to share with the community that I try to be a part of. 

This sub really sucks as of late. I find myself coming here less and less. So much front page content is reposted/over-used memes and art projects. The mods really need to do a better job of consistently moderating the sub. posted to submission: Rule 10 on this subreddit should be reviewed. After arguing with a mod this is clearer to me and other content creators than ever.

It honestly has been rough to see that people are telling me that I need therapy because im not comfortable with my sexuality bc i called her slutty. I'm not trying to shame other women who like sex. I completely think he played her just as much as he played me. I dont blame her for wanting to be a third, I myself have tried to do that.

There are over 100 million gun owners in the US. If even 5% of them do this they'll outnumber the entire military (including reservists) more than 2 to 1. And that's counting all of the support jobs like cooks, supply, maintenance, etc. Combat arms are only about 2% of the military.

 > If he created a trust and transferred all his items to that trust, would that be $200 per item?

Yes. And a Form 4, copy of the trust, fingerprints, photographs, and the $200 tax per item. 

 > Is it possible to transfer the NFA (to me) without being on a trust? 

Generally, yes. While he's living, it's conducted as a standard Form 4 transfer to you (or a trust). Before he passes on, he should incorporate into his will a specific list of NFA items and specific direction on what he wants done with those items (I.e. give them to you). After he passes away, the executor of the will would have to complete a Form 5 for each item and submit to the NFA branch, along with photographs and fingerprints for each Form 5. They can be transferred to a trust, but it would definitely help if the will expressly stated they were to go to the "PickYourName NFA Trust", HuntConsMarc, trustee. 

 > What‚Äôs the best way to go about this?

Take your pick. If you expect to share possession of the items, establishing a trust as the target of his inheritance would be a smart move. To transfer items before he passes away would require payment of multiple tax stamps and long waits. If it's in the will, though, the executor is duty bound to dispose of the property as specified and it's a tax exempt transfer. 

 > Does it matter if it‚Äôs a Suppressor, SBR or MG? 

Only in terms of whether the items are legal in your current state and whether they require registration separate from the federal system in that state. Otherwise, they should all go through the same process.

[22:30:40] Comment: dz1a7tg by sickhippie : If Just Cause 3 had been the first one I'd played, I'd think it was a blast because it *is* a blast.  But compared to JC2?  Doesn't come close.  JC2 had a much bigger (and more varied) map, ten times the collectibles, had a better progression system (chaos and factions instead of challenges), significantly better vehicle handling, is just generally more *fun* to play through, was still gorgeous on lower-end hardware, and had modding support.

They're both fun games, but JC3 is a step backwards from JC2 everywhere except personal mobility, and those upgrades are gated behind the godawful challenge system.

Again, I'm not saying it'll be a bad game.  I enjoyed JC3 all the way through.  But by the end, I was pushing myself to actually finish it.  In JC2 I finished the game and just kept exploring and blowing shit up.  I've got less than half the time in JC3 than I do in JC2, and still go back and play JC2 every so often. posted to submission: Avalanche Studios are developing RAGE 2.

There was one with Nikki Knights and she kept calling the guy Roger, beige couch, ended doggy, he pulled out and no hands came on her ass, and she twerked as he came - again slowmo

There was then two scenes with Aja, one with her wearing white lace(cumshot on ass), the other with a tube top(facial/tits)

I have found the two Aja clips.  I have not found the Nikki Knights clip(I have found everything but that clip).

St. Helens. I believe this pass is valid throughout Oregon and Washington [wherever a day pass is typically required](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r6/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev2_027003). I like it because it gives me access to coasts, forests, and mountains, and it only costs $35.

I agree that it's kind of confusing because there are multiple government agencies that issue passes for the land that is under their jurisdiction, and I don't think there is a whole lot of overlap between them. The Forest Service falls within the US Department of Agriculture, while the National Parks Service and the USGS are attached to the Department of the Interior. Oregon Parks and Rec has their own passes for state-controlled land too. The NW Forest Pass seems to cover the most ground. 

Hope this helps.  posted to submission: Suggestions/insight for parking/access passes for natural areas in Oregon?

[22:31:30] Comment: dz1a7u0 by d4vezac : He‚Äôs got a very unique package of skills‚ÄîDPOY, mobile center who‚Äôs the best help defender in the league meets one of the three best passing big men in the league meets one of the only forwards  (and maybe the only center?) in the league who can lead a fast break. On a team with no scorers, he turns them into the ~80 points allowed per game Grizzlies from a few years ago at best. I think his value to any of the ten best teams in the league is clear, though, because he unlocks extra dimensions while giving up very little. To your point about his shooting vs. Rondo‚Äôs, I disagree. Even if they‚Äôre around the same rate, the fact that you‚Äôre getting that level of shooting from your 4/5 means he‚Äôs at least average vs. most of his peers. Rondo‚Äôs inability to shoot from the point guard position is a liability to his teams. When you weigh the benefits of Rondo, you‚Äôre stacking his shooting against Curry, Paul, Conley, Kylie, Lillard. With Draymond, you‚Äôre weighing it against Horford, Gasol...Davis? Who else? Almost league average three point shooting from someone in Green‚Äôs body is far more valuable than the same in Rondo‚Äôs body. posted to submission: [Forsberg] Parish on Brad Stevens: "I'm not saying Brad Stevens should not be getting praise for the job that he's done because I feel like he's done an outstanding job.

Our day long Chicago show went as usual although we talked on headset about the majority of people wearing homspun and bonnets.  Show went well (we had some pyro, multi-media etc on a big wide screen, big sound and all.)  The homespun men stayed right up front after the show and a head guy came up to me and said :"Brother we thank you so much for all your work presenting this wonderful show.  Please let us work together to put it all away with you.  Show us how."  It was absolutely great. Speaker positions, scaffolding, draping staging, tech gear in the right road boxes.  As a crew I think we worked harder for about an hour directing and showing where things went.  We didn't touch a road box much.  Then they pushed it all on the 50' trailer for us and thank us.  Later they all drove away in darker cars with the chrome all painted black.  Great people.... some sort religious community.

[22:32:37] Comment: dz1aehy by krashnburn117 : This GAIT analysis thing and pronation talk is overhyped if you ask me. I had a ASICS Gel Kayano which is a stability model to correct pronation which retailed for 12k then. I started getting leg pain after some months. Switched brands and went with a neutral shoe and never used Kayano for running again.
Later I saw that ASICS had a stall in TCS10K Bengaluru expo and got a GAIT analysis done and they suggested me a Kayano. I'm sure there's some science to it but it's not exactly black or white. Trial and error still works best.

Pro tips for shoes: 
1. Check for thumbs width after big toe. Any tighter would cramp your toes or casue black toes while running.
2. Don't expect it to loosen up. Buy what is comfortable now.
3. If you can access a treadmill test run and return if it doesn't feel right.
4. More cushion may not always be better for you. posted to submission: Hey /r/india what are some purchases that improved your quality of life?

[22:33:08] Comment: dz1aeia by KiNiNarimasu- : To those wondering how I intend to use him:  

[Gems.](https://i.imgur.com/Hrz6xPg.png) Conviction with HP, HP, Def with focus on res subs primarily, and then def/CritR secondary.

His only real strength is PvP offense as variant lead. 

The main idea is to have primarily Light Leo get his active and stun the hell out of enemies via pugilist + active (fully booked). Maybe add a mon that can disable within the first turn (without relying on just pugilist), like my Light Thor (to tank attacks away from Dark mons on Leo) or so. Then perhaps one decent dmg dealer like S. Light Nike or so, I'll have to see.

Since I might run him as my only Dark Mon and in lead position, I'm going with max. Res conviction set instead of ~50-60% res non-ideal pugilist set. He must be able to tank and I'd just like him to resist as much as possible. If I had godly pugilist sets with maybe 75%+ Res I'd choose that over conviction but yeh...

[22:33:20] Comment: dz1aeii by WikiTextBot : **Motorman**

See Operation Motorman for the British Army operation in Northern Ireland



A motorman is the title for a person who operates an electrified trolley car, tram, light rail, or rapid transit train.

The term refers to the person who is in charge of the motor (of the electric car) in the same sense as a railroad engineer is in charge of the engine. The term was (and, where still used, is) gender-neutral. Though motormen have historically been male, females in the position (such as in the United States during the World Wars) were usually also called motormen as a job title.

Woman decides to have sex? Her choice as much as the man's.

Woman decides to go forward with the pregnancy? Her choice solely.

We have to wait to see the ratio on the passive, but I don't think it makes sense for them to go for a support that ditches utility items for an ad build like everyone is saying. Why would that be the case even if he's supposed to be an assassin? He needs other people to do the damage considering his kit, he's not like zed who dives into a team, kills the squishy and comes back alive.

[22:35:21] Comment: dz1ala7 by Demi_Bob : My cat gets stuck like this occasionally (especially if I've been lazy about clipping his nails). When you try to help him, he struggles and usually makes it worse.  What I don't totally understand, or just makes me curious, is that physiologically he should be perfectly capable of getting himself unstuck.  In fact, if you leave him to it long enough, he usually will but not before taking on the persona of a individual in an infomercial.  "Does this ever happen to you?"

My curiosity is one of mental faculty, I suppose.  He's perfectly capable of learning, so I don't quite understand why it takes him so long to get unstuck when the solution is always the same.  So is it just a matter of instinct that leads to this struggle?

Anyone else have a cat that's figured this out?

[22:35:36] Comment: dz1alal by Albatross_in_the_Sky : The final level gives multiple good units to the player, I'm fairly certain its quite difficult to hit a "game over" state if you have played more than a few Fire Emblem games. In addition, you can grind as much as you want on Holmes route, and you can swap units between Runan and Holmes multiple times, making it very difficult to screw yourself over completely unless you sent all good units on one route for whatever reason. In addition, you have the leeway of letting a couple units die and then reviving them.

I did not use Narron my first playthrough and managed to beat TRS, so you can probably beat it as well.

[22:35:41] Comment: dz1alaq by adiostrasero : Well, first of all, that sucks. My baby was born a month early too and had failure to thrive, and it's REALLY hard. I didn't realize how being even a month early would have a huge impact on her health, so I bet a lot of your friends don't know either. And yes, the conflicting advice is ridiculous. 

I think your feelings are valid - no matter how supportive a partner is, breastfeeding ultimately falls on the mom, and that's especially hard when there is so much pressure to get a baby to eat enough. It sucks that your partner and family didn‚Äôt listen to you and that you‚Äôve been having a hard time. And that‚Äôs really all your friend had to say, right? When people complain, typically they just want some recognition/validation and then we can all move on. It doesn‚Äôt sound like you complained excessively. 

I‚Äôm wondering if you triggered something for your friend that you‚Äôre unaware of - like is she maybe trying for a baby herself and can‚Äôt handle someone with a baby complaining? Does she maybe have problems with her family and it‚Äôs hard for her to hear anyone complaining about theirs? 

You know yourself best, but if it were me, I‚Äôd give myself a bit of time before possibly confronting the friend. I‚Äôm about 4 months postpartum and I still don‚Äôt quite feel like myself, emotionally. I feel like I‚Äôm more sensitive and quicker to anger than I was before. This doesn‚Äôt mean that what your friend did wasn‚Äôt still shitty, but you may say something you don‚Äôt really mean if you try to talk about it now.

This lets you choose when to use Greedo beneficially, but once you do, the next time you take damage, one of your damage cards is exposed. It also means that you must take damage from something to get Greedo back.

[22:39:17] Comment: dz1arsx by folsleet : E&Y is an accounting firm.  When any company like the NBA hires E&Y there's normally one partner who handles the account.  If there's pressure  applied to manipulate results, it's primarily applied to that partner.  And the NBA itself has competing groups.  As with any group, you'll have subgroups with diverging interests.   It doesn't take many people if they really, really want to manipulate results.

Now, obviously a big accounting firm like E&Y has numerous fail safe mechanisms to ensure one partner can't ruin the entire company's reputation.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

[22:39:42] Comment: dz1arte by jverity : >that's irrelevant to the discussion.

No, you have it backwards, it's directly related to the discussion.  Look at the title.  "Abortion should be legal..."  For that discussion it does not matter at what point a group of cells is considered a human.  You could be saying it should be legal to have 4th trimester abortions for that matter.  Post birth.  

But how much care you show for actual living humans is definitely relevant to whatever legislation you want to impose concerning unborn ones.  In a society where murder was legal, there'd be no point in even thinking about abortion restrictions.  And while we haven't gone that far yet, denying living people health care is pretty much the same thing, except no one has to live with the guilt of pulling an actual trigger.  In many ways, it's worse.  Longer, more tortuous deaths with no one to blame or prosecute.  

Again, when pro-lifers show me they actually take life seriously, then I'll take them seriously.  So far I just see them insulting women who are making a hard choice in a bad situation and occasionally killing doctors.  They are so busy "saving those who cant speak for themselves" that they can't be bothered to help people who are literally begging to be saved. posted to submission: CMV: Abortion should be legal in every country and to not be frowned upon.

At first I generally played games that I could easily pause and walk away from if my son woke up \(I generally took over night duties\). Eventually they will start sleeping through the night which obviously opens up more time for games.

And generally my wife uses that time to do stuff she wants to do as well. So most housework is halted and it's a lot of us mostly doing things we can't generally do while the kids are awake. posted to submission: Dad gamers: are you still playing games? Did you think you wouldn't be?

You understand that you can say faggot to me now because of the **context** you're using it in. 

If white people can't ever say nigger no matter what, then straight people can't say faggot. Mentally sound people can't say retard. You might as well be consistent if you insist on playing word police. But I'd much rather you took some time to think about how language is a tool to communicate what we mean on our minds, and *how* we use certain words demonstrates different things in our minds.  posted to submission: [Poetry] epic police chase

Practise makes perfect, most of those streamers have 1k+ hrs put into DbD and knows how to juke and all of that. Just keep playing, you'll get there!

[22:43:46] Comment: dz1b5bc by Hautamaki : Shapiro is whatever, a typical boring conservative with no new ideas or interesting new ways of formulating them that I've ever seen.  The Weinsteins are the same on the other end; typical liberals (lumping them in with Shapiro who is their polar opposite is absurd of course).  The justifiable criticism of Peterson is that he is way too overly focused on leftist activists while ignoring or even apologizing for right wing fanatics, which is probably based on his biased personal experiences and circumstances.  But Peterson's overall message of individual identity and personal responsibility as the key to overcoming shitty identity politics is true.  If you want to know what Peterson is really all about, you have to watch his own lecture videos that he puts up himself, not these stupid interview clips or excerpts put out by various third party left or right wing ideologues looking to cash in on someone else.  

The criticism of Harris is far stupider.  Harris is 'guilty' of not having enough black people on his show?  This is a typical identity politics criticism that has no rational or logical justification.  Harris did not strongly enough condemn Charles Murray along racist lines?  Okay... but he was there to talk about the science, not the politics.  Then when Ezra Klein called him out for it, again Harris said he agreed with Klein on the politics right from the outset but only wanted to talk about the science while Klein only wanted to hammer on about the politics that Harris was already willing to agree on.  Politically speaking, nobody has been more brutally critical or spent more time articulating in excruciating detail Trump's manifest unfitness for presidency, and the unforgivable stupidity, ignorance, or outright bigotry of his supporters than Harris has.

And the underlying criticism of the one thing they all have in common is that they are popular online and make a lot of money on online media.  Okay.  Good point I guess.  Fuck those guys for having a lot of followers that are happy to financially support them I guess?  But other than the apparent envy leaking through this supposed 'criticism', what's the actual criticism?  That their free speech is not actually impinged as they worry about?  But they actually were violently protested on university campuses and 'de-platformed'.  Those were real events that actually happened and have been documented.  Bill C-16 that Jordan Peterson criticized was actually passed.  Provincial Human Rights Tribunals really have censured and punished people for making inappropriate jokes, and one TA was formally censured by her university for daring to show a CBC clip of Jordan Peterson in a class about meda.  That is a real thing that actually happened.  So yeah, these guys are getting their messages out there successfully, but it's not like they have invented or made up the things that they are complaining about.  You can talk about the correct proportionality of their complaint, relative to right-wing extremist terrorists actually committing mass killings, of course, or of Trump's obvious anti-LGBT and anti-non-white-immigrant policies, of course those are valid points and criticisms to make (and something that Sam Harris and the Weinsteins would be among the first to agree with) but that's not what this author was up to.  He quite plainly sees these guys as intellectual 'enemies' and has written repeated blatantly biased hit-pieces to try to 'take them down' as his 'enemies'.  When that's his attitude, there's obviously no point in any of them engaging further with him. posted to submission: Conservatives‚Äô ludicrous new excuse: Liberals made us vote for Donald Trump!

The way I learn them is to learn only the pronunciation for that kanji alone, then when it is used in another word, learn that word, not the pronunciation of the Kanji in it. Then it comes much more naturally.

Approximately 20 people were involved in the attack on Westminster, and 17280 / 20 = 864. Applying a standard 3x reps factor this brings your total to 2592, which we are rounding down to 2400 diamonds.

[22:45:34] Comment: dz1b5cj by romaeus98 : Would you think a modified version of the 24/7 game is a good idea?

If you dont know what it is it's basically a game a couple made up to hide notes for each other in the house with a sexual command or fetish 

Like go to the bathroom and send me nudes 

Or come find me and have sex with me 

Was thinking it would be a good idea to do the same thing but hand each other like 8 letters at a time and only 4 can be opened at a time. So once one is completed another may be opened but another must be written. 

Some examples could be 
Car sex 
Next time you masturbate send me a video 
Etc. 

And once you receive a letter back its almost like a turn on because out of nowhere you know something's coming. 

We also both love surprises so this could be a lot of fun!

It also takes the ease off with writing it down and handing it to them because you dont really have to talk about it. And once seeing what the other writes down you can see the boundaries and push them a bit over time? posted to submission: Exploring New Opportunities with my SO

[22:45:40] Comment: dz1b5cq by lionheart4life : They waste too much of the storyline on each talent's origin/development in NXT and by the time they get called up with the same character there is nothing left.  See also Bayley, Tyler Breeze, American Alpha, etc.

The call-ups should either portray a different character or just not be overexposed before being called up.  Elias' gimmick is great because he hasn't been doing the exact same thing on NXT tv for 1-2 years first.

AoP were so good for so long in NXT that if they don't immediately win or challenge for the tag titles they're going to look like bums posted to submission: Were the Authors of Pain called up without any plans?

[22:45:46] Comment: dz1b5ct by brentnotbroken : Withdrawing consent means "if I say stop, you have to stop." It does not mean deciding today that the sex I consented to yesterday was rape. Retroactive consent-status changes are not a thing.

What sometimes happens is this: "I am deeply uncomfortable with something that happened, but I'm afraid of what will happen to me if I speak up about it, so I'll just not say anything", and someone else interpreting that as "well, she didn't complain, so she must have been on board with everything.

He was the player I wanted look up to, and he was always able to answer questions and offer help. I ended up creating a 55 monk and was farming Underworld for ectos many, many months later. I'll never forget where I started, and how amazing people can be, even in a video game. This is why I love this game.

[22:47:22] Comment: dz1bbtt by KrivenRaven : > The double standard of eating some animals but not dogs/cats/horses is a valid point nonetheless imo.

It really isn't. Pigs, cows and chickens wouldn't exist if we did not breed them into existence specifically to eat them. Dogs came to us of their own volition and would not exist if we did not breed them as companions. Cats are getting to the point that dogs are at, but they're still a little more wild. Horses are barely different from their ancestors, and purely domestic breeds again exist for companionship and labor--not eating.

[22:47:32] Comment: dz1bbts by potato_leak_soup : Phycsian assitants are always licensed under a Doctor, normally doctors will hire out a few PAs or Nurse practitioners to work under them. Assuming that‚Äôs the case here, you can always request to see the Doctor the license is under or other PAs or NPs.  Just call the receptionist and ask it may take a while to get an appointment but it‚Äôll be worth it if they can prescribe you the care you need.  When/if you get another appointment downplay the hours spent playing video games. Or rather reframe it as a symptom of impulsivity, it‚Äôs the dysfunction of your planning and forethought module rather than spending time doing something you like. For example: I shouldn‚Äôt be typing this reddit post but here I am, the thought didn‚Äôt pop into my head until just now after typing for 5 minutes, I didn‚Äôt even really notice I was doing, but here I am. And now I want to finish it since I have a need to try to finish tasks because I seem to drop the ball all the time. The hyper focusing aspect of ADHD is imo one of the core reasons people are dismissive of the disorder, to someone who isn‚Äôt around or doesn't expiernce the disorder it will seem like an advantage.  Unfortunately there is also a bias against the typical distractions ADHDers fall into, especially when it comes to things like video games or social media.  When I was studying neorscience we had to read paper after paper about addictions, whether it was stimulants, opiates or even video games and internet, it was in vogue at the time. They forced it down your throat in my department whether you were in Med School or just studying Neuro. I assume your PA had a similar experience, or just indadiquite training, or they just don‚Äôt give a fuck.  We like to pretend here that there is a universally accepted medical reason for ADHD, but there are still papers coming out saying that it isn‚Äôt a disorder...

Anyway, point being is you are most likely not going to change this PAs mind, so try the other doctors in that office. Also call your insurance and ask them to refer you to a psychiatrist or GP who has expierwnce in ADHD. Id say 90% of insurances have more than one one option for doctors in any given area. Even if this doctor is your primary care you can ask to change. Your insurance can help you with finding care and as long as you aren‚Äôt asking for money the customer service people should be happy to help, that‚Äôs part of their job take, take advantage of that. posted to submission: My PA just told me that ‚Äúif you can sit and play video games for two hours, it‚Äôs obvious that you can focus.‚Äù

[22:48:36] Comment: dz1bhnj by Afirebearer : > but why is it the right answer? 

Because only sentient beings are capable of having interests. It's the difference between kicking a rock and kicking a chicken. A rock has no interests on its own - kicking a rock can only be morally problematic if there's a sentient being who cares about it. On the other hand, a chicken is able to have interests and to generate meaning on its own. Thus, whether to take those interests into consideration or not becomes a moral question.

> I have at the moment is that it is grounded in our instincts and intuitions as shaped by evolution.

I find it hard to believe that you really think that we should follow our moral intuitions. It's common knowledge that racism has a strong evolutionary basis. The same could be said for rape and many other instincts that no one would dare to call "moral".

>An organism capable of using language so that it can appear to reason about morality itself;

What about small children? What about mentally-impaired people? Are they moral agent only because they are potentially part of the group we call "persons"?

>just to understand that alternative worldviews exist and aren't obviously nonsensical from the inside

I'm well aware that there are people who don't share my moral view. I used to be one of those people. This doesn't mean that all their views are equally right. I'm sure that there are a lot of people who think that 2+2 doesn't equal 5, or that the earth is only 2000 years old. Does that mean that they are all correct answers? posted to submission: How many atheists are there? - Marginal REVOLUTION

[22:49:07] Comment: dz1bho0 by JapanHasRice2 : 1. **Strategy name:** Ctrl+F: No Reno?

2. **Boss:** Kraken

3. **Describe your Strategy:** `3/3 trinity`/`Sub 60`/`Mage Team`/`No Chain`/`No +Lightning Equip`
Reno spams USB and Chain Thundaga while Garnet helps. No +Lightning equipment at all. Hope Reno doesn't get stopped.
No one is 5\* dived except for Shelke. Everyone else is full 4\* dive.

Couldn't find a post with Reno. So here it is.

4. ***Insight!:***

 * Turn 1) Shelke: Wrath. Rikku: USB1. Reno: Fabula Guardian. Garnet: USB. Eiko Angelsong.

 * Turn 1.5) Shelke: Wrath.

 * Turn 2) Shelke: Entrust Reno. Rikku: Mana's Paean. Reno: USB. Garnet: Curaja. Eiko: Curada.

 * Turn 3) Shelke: Wrath. Rikku: Garuda. Reno: Chain Thundaga. Garnet: Curaja/Valigarmanda depending on HP. Eiko: Curada

 * Turn 4+ Shelke) Continues Wrath/Entrust. Usually the second Entrust (after maybe 3 Wraths) is to Eiko who needs to get Last Stand up and have some extra bars for when the fight quickly goes south. During this timeframe, Reno can handle his own throwing out Chain Thundagas. Once Eiko has at least 2 bars stocked and Last Stand active, remaining bars to go Reno unless Eiko runs out. Sometimes I'll have her toss a bar at Garnet in the very late stages just so Garnet has something to do after Valigarmanda is used up.

 * Turn 4+ Rikku) Rikku keeps Mana's Paean up and hopes for some imperils from Spark Offering. Honing Spark Offering may offer consistency, but it's not going to make or break the run. Rikku at this point is also the dedicated RW and magicite summoner. Recasting USB around 25s and RW at about 31.

 * Turn 4+ Eiko) Continues casting Curada until first bar, if anyone is in danger of dying to a savage attack, cast the first USB. If everyone is full up, hold her turn until the attack comes, then USB to heal back up and get the safety net of Last Stand active. If she has a lot of spare bars, I usually hold her turn until someone's Last Stand procs and then USB to refresh. Otherwise, casting Curada for HP stock and SB generation.

 * Turn 4+ Reno) Deal lightning damage.

 * Turn 4+ Garnet) Garnet's turns are trickier to get the feel for. In the very early turns, she's helping heal. Once everyone has Last Stand, she can safely start to cast Valigarmanda. The gist is to not cast Valigarmanda on the same turn as Reno using Chain Thundaga and Rikku using Spark Offering. Kraken can turn around with 3 counter attacks and an AoE to keep you humble. Other than that, you just have to assess how safe/stable your party is before casting.

 * General notes: If Reno gets stopped, the run is over. If Eiko gets stopped, you'll probably be fine unless it hits before you have Last Stand up. Even then, it's relatively short-lived on her. If Garnet gets stopped, no problem. If Rikku gets stopped, Garnet/Shelke take over RW/magicite duties until it wears. If Shelke gets stopped, the run can go either way. If you have a +MND weapon she can equip, do so. Reno doesn't need bars after the first until Chain Thundaga runs out, which could be longer if I were to hone it more.

5. **Holy Trinity casts:** 
 * Wall: 2
 * Medica: lots
 * Hastega: ^ + 2
6. **S/L count / Medals lost:** 0 S/L in first 2 runs (though definitely some potential) / 1 medal lost
7. **Roaming Warrior / Magicite:** Fabula Guardian / Garuda

|Hero|Ability 1|Ability 2|RM|LM1|LM2|SB(-)|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
|Eiko, lvl99, s.lvl33|Curada R3|Angelsong R1|Battleforged|-|-|USB|
|Garnet, lvl99, s.lvl30|Curaja R5|Valigarmanda R4|Dr. Mog's Teachings|-|-|USB|
|Shelke, lvl99, s.lvl47|Entrust R3|Wrath R5|Ace Striker|LM1|LM2|-|
|Rikku, lvl99, s.lvl30|Spark Offering R1|Mana's Paean R5|Mako Might|-|-|USB1|
|Reno, lvl99, s.lvl30|Chain Thundaga R3|Chain Thundaga R2|Scholar's Boon|-|-|USB|  

|Main Magicite, lvl|Sub1|Sub2|Sub3|Sub4|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
|Garuda, lvl85|Mimic Queen, lvl99 (+10 Empower Lightning)|Enlil, lvl99 (+5 Empower Lightning|Firemane, lvl99|Ixion, lvl99| 

8. **Final Notes:**

Everyone has water resist gear. Can swap Garuda out for Ixion as main if the incoming damage is too much. This team is hitting the buff cap for magic. If I had another who could dish out lightning damage, I'd drop Garnet. Her AoE damage makes it so that Kraken has to be manually targeted for nearly the entire fight. posted to submission: [4 Star Magicite Dungeons] Savage Kraken Clear Megathread

SK is a close ally. NK or not, we conduct drills with them as we do in any other area. That shouldn't be dictated by NK, even before a summit has even taken place. 

I apologize if my next statement comes off as arrogant, but I don't get how this isn't obvious. You have to maintain leverage. It isn't even about whether the drills are needed or not. That can be negotiated and agreed upon down the line.

[22:49:35] Comment: dz1bhof by KmndrKeen : Not any particular franchise, but the pub industry. Owners are always trying to be "unique" and "trendy" while completely missing the fucking point. A successful pub has 3 keys;

A small menu. Don't fuck around, have a list of a few key ingredients and build a menu around those. Wings, a good burger and a steak sandwich is all you really need, and beyond that the ingredients you can stock for those can be used to make a few other dishes like salads and stuff. Don't get carried away, and if your menu doesn't fit on one page with large text, it's too big. The added bonus to this is that you don't need an all star chef to fry up wings or flip burgers. 

Daily specials. Yes, you make less money on the special. Boo fucking hoo. It gets people in the door and keeps them coming back. Keep your specials simple, and don't fuck around. A Tuesday beer special should be a Tuesday beer special until the bar gets bought out.

Hot staff. I know, it's sexist. So fucking what. It works. When your waitress is drop dead gorgeous, you buy more beer and tip better. When the bartender is Tom fucking cruise in cocktail, girls bring their friends. Hot staff is a must, and if you don't believe me, take a look at the difference between a dive bar and a successful one. 

Too many bars are in a constant state of flux because people don't get that there is a very simple formula to success. Follow the rules and you'll do just fine. posted to submission: What franchise is now decaying and how would you save it if given the opportunity?

[22:51:49] Comment: dz1boat by EpikSwag : I stated true, then proceeded to (admittedly ineffectively) qualify that with the observation that many people today perpetuate this [practical] problem "in the name of" fighting it rhetorically. 

The US political duopoly lends itself to us doing so, however, as *everything* becomes a matter of "this platform solves this problem because it's the platform of the GOP/DNC"; whereas any critical evaluation to test if the [practical] problem is actually being addressed by said platform is perceived as a (sometimes personal) attack on the party alleged values and the character of its constituents.

[22:53:00] Comment: dz1bobw by Hautamaki : China was a shit show since the 1800s.  The Taiping Rebellion, entirely inside China, claimed more lives than WW1.  Life expectancy in Japanese controlled China was actually higher than outside of Japanese controlled China--and they killed 22 million civilians!  Then life expectancy under Mao went up even when another 45+ million civilians starved to death in his reign!

So yeah, China's problems long pre-date Mao.  A total mass murdering psychopath like him could never have seized power if they didn't.  Ancient China was a great civilization but culturally they were still stuck at the Feudal stage when Europe went through the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution and that made them a relative horror show on par with 1300s Europe right up into the 20th century. posted to submission: Four major airlines quietly changed their references to Taiwan ‚Äî and it shows just how much power China has over foreign companies

At this point she‚Äôs so far gone there‚Äôs really nothing anyone can do, you know? And her mother is looking so terrible. From the videos I‚Äôve seen I think she needs to go to a home or something. It‚Äôs not healthy for her and Chris to live alone together. Chris doesn‚Äôt understand money and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen when her mom kicks it, she definitely won‚Äôt last long on her own and it doesn‚Äôt sound like there‚Äôs anyone else.
Tbh, Chris‚Äôs dad seemed like a good man but I think he was too proud to let Chris go to a special school and that may have been an important turning point. I feel bad for both of Chris‚Äôs parents but they should have done more. Her mother def spoiled her rotten and I think another thing was her winning all of those contests at such a young age. That part isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault but I‚Äôm sure it fed into her growing narcissism.
Julie was crazy. I‚Äôm not surprised to find out she was a 13 year old boy. I like to think all the trolls were young, idiot kids who don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre doing but they just put so much *work* into everything, making up fake countries and staging these dramatic rapes and deaths, and holy shit that entire Nintendo saga. As much of an asshole Chris may be she didn‚Äôt deserve that. 
I remember getting pretty pissed off at that one episode where one of the trolls told Chris to kill himself and the rest turned on him like ‚Äúhey, man you‚Äôre taking it too far‚Äù like, no guys, telling someone to kill themselves is probably the least intense thing you‚Äôve been doing. It‚Äôs all been emotional abuse, honestly.  I can‚Äôt even always tell what‚Äôs real and fake with that documentary.

You live close, but that doesn't mean you have to talk to him at all. There are people who live two doors down from me in the same apartment building that I've never spoken to. You can avoid this man if you choose, or call the cops on him if he tries to get in contact with you against your will. But either way, end it. 

You are not unlovable. This is not your fault. This is his fault, and you have been listening to his bullshit for so long you've started to believe him. You are a lovely, lovable person. And you'll discover that about yourself again once you get free of his clutches. You just need to do the breaking up part first.  posted to submission: Need help understanding what is going on and how to proceed with my life. I feel broken, unlovable, and completely lost.

Doesn't really help much with the complete lack of sleep though. 3 kids, 12, 8, and 7. Extracurriculars, mountains of laundry, meals, appointments, you name it. Same scheduling nightmares as everybody else! I don't really have any family support close by, so it's a good thing I make a decent buck. I can afford to have a summer nanny.

Day starts at 6 when I get the middle schooler up, get him going and then out the door. Little ones get up at 7, breakfast and lunches made, morning reading done and then off to school. I get them on the bus and get to work. Get off at 4 p.m., run home. I hire high schoolers from the high school near my house to perform an hour or two of Aftercare and meet them when they get off the bus. Homework, meal prep, dinner, dad's, normal Night Time stuff. They're usually in bed by 8, and then I start doing chores! Typically get to bed around 10:30 or 11, and then get up and do it all over again... posted to submission: Interested in knowing what all y‚Äôalls do for work, how you make it financially?

[22:56:10] Comment: dz1bvfc by TwistedBrother : Just listen on Macquarie for the dum-dum. 

It‚Äôs properly speaking 4/4  but there are six measures so it goes 
Bass-2-3-4
Bass-2-3-4
Bass-2-3-4
1-2-3-4
Kick-kick-3-4
1-2-3-4

Where almost all modern songs have a 4-bar structure. These extra two bars give Macquarie Ridge that sense that the song is slowing down. 

The album is full of interesting features like that. 

For example, the full melody of Constants are Changing is never heard, as in the counterpoint of the bass and the phased organ are never there for a complete measure. You hear parts of the full melody, like a pendulum is slowly swinging over the instruments.  posted to submission: ‚ÄúOpen the Light‚Äù is incredibly underrated

I really don‚Äôt see that happening without leftists piercing the political funding bubble by getting some bourgeoisie on our side and then using their money  to start a leftist super pac or something like that.

They have routines and structure, learning guidelines, they're required to fill out paperwork and have background checks, they do this all day every day and have for far more years than I have. If she were with me I'd be focused on doing other things while watching her (like laundry and errands and my own hobbies) and I probably wouldn't give her the attention she gets there. She also certainly wouldn't get the kind of social interaction she does there. Plus they provide healthy well balanced meals every day.

[22:56:23] Comment: dz1bvft by thatnameagain : >Why is postponing/cancelling a military drill == closing bases and reducing troop presence?

The drills are central to U.S. presence there, as they are the main way that the SK military keeps it's defenses ready. So conceding on this issue right off the bat even before negotiations really start moves the goalposts immensely in NK's favor, and in regards to the disposition of U.S. troops. Nothing would send a clearer signal that things like base closures and troop reductions are on the table than cancelling a major military drill out of politeness towards NK's vanity (they are not actually threatened by these drills that have happened for decades, they pretend to be).

>I don't think anyone is suggesting that the we pull troops out of SK for nothing.

[22:57:35] Comment: dz1c1ih by Maurodamia : and? I'm just saying look at his foot positioning because that tells the tale. 99.999% of MMA fans have no clue what they are looking at. 

Why does Forrest have no power? Look at his feet and hips...

Why does Forrest go down so easily? Again, look at his foot positioning (lack of base).

Wanderlei was another one who got knocked down a few times and the vast majority said it was his chin. Not at all, he was running forward swinging wild, totally off balance and went down because of that.

Its the same for takedowns, if your feet are too close together you will be taken down quite easily. posted to submission: Your weekly Anderson vs Forrest Matrix gif from a lesser known angle.

I don't quite understand this. One can be excessive in their ideology while still having high legitimacy and sympathy within said ideology. Both of them saw tremendous injustices in the world and wished Wakanda would stop putting a blind eye to it. His father witnessed friends' deaths to it firsthand. Killmonger not only witnessed it firsthand, but had even more pent up rage after Wakanda's will to be ignorant went far enough to kill his father.

In those scenes, nothing of their malicious behavior shows through. Just their hope and drive for freedom and justice that they originally had set out for. posted to submission: Honest Trailers - Black Panther

[22:57:44] Comment: dz1c1iq by Awelyne : I am shocked on how much you all pay for your skating! Lets see if I reach that level as well.
I skated as a child and teenager, but now as an adult I only do two ice sessions (1 h each) a week and two off-ice sessions (also 1 h each) each week, so a total of 2 h ice and 2 h off-ice per week.

During winter, the rink is open for the public for free three times a week, and I usually make it once a week.

Costs:
Skating club membership fee 200 SEK(23$) /year
Skating lessons 2h ice and 2h off ice/week Jan-mars/april (Winter season) 600 SEK/70$ (this means about 3$/1 h ice+ 1 h off-ice lesson, since thay always come together at my skating club.)
Skating lessons 2 h ice and 2h off-ice/week April-May (Spring season) 400 SEK/46$

The skating lessons fee includes insurance while skating, one choreographed programme per season, tests (arranged by our club) and entry fees to two local competitions per season.

It costs 100 SEK/12$ to get your blades sharpend.

I dont compete anymore so I have no fees for music or costume.

This is all at a local rink in the far north of Sweden. The club is run voluntarily by everyone except the coaches who get paid, but I dont know their hourly payment. Our club has some sponsors and I think the city subsidize the rental for clubs that involve activities for children. posted to submission: How much do you spend on figure skating?
[22:57:45] Comment: dz1c1ir by spleeble : Of the three I like the first one the best. 

If you go with Campagnolo ergo/STI shifters get something Chorus or higher I would say. In some years Veloce and Centaur are not as robust or serviceable and it's hard to know. You seem to be after something more classic though. 

$300 for the Ishiwata would be a great deal, and $350 or $400 is fine if that's what you are lusting after.  posted to submission: Looking for a cure for my Celeste Bianchi lust.

Jungle dives and u dead now. They also have amazing escapes, even from a grakk grab all three of them can escape. Try that with Yorn or Valhein or any other ADC/mage.

She glares at him. "And no - this sort of thing was *not* what you are here to learn. *Nothing* was wrong, and there was *no* likelihood of anyone sabotaging a shuttle. An engineer was in his assigned work area, doing his assigned job, under the direct supervision of his assigned mentor. There is *nothing* wrong about that situation. And the fact that Lt.

I used this tent alone so ventilation and condensation wasn't an issue. If you used it with two people condensation will probably happen some. This was in NC btw with moderate humidity and around 70 degrees. 

I love the look and design of this tent. Only thing I disliked was that the zipper on the front was not a two way zipper (only goes up from the bottom).  posted to submission: [WTS] Naturehike Taga 2 w/ footprint. $100 shipped.
[22:59:44] Comment: dz1c60r by frizzykid : Ok I dont understand why OP would have to reread from the beginning though if the facts are still being presented properly which they do. 

Just because there is filler which adds extra plot and the anime shifts a few story plots around to work with the filler (like the Ace filler during alabasta)  But I dont see why you would need to start the whole series over. 

Like Ive seen the posts of things that are different in the anime and the Manga and its 9 times out of 10 its just censorship rather than a scene being left out all together, Like luffy's scar on his eye, or Whitebeard having half his face blown off by akainu rather than just losing part of his mustache.  posted to submission: starting manga

HBO is already working on 5 prequels to replace GoT.        
That timeslot will be occupied for a long time.         
They also have the rights to I, Claudius (which could work chronologically with ''Rome'') but they put it on hold because of GoT.    

Scorsese and the 'Vikings' writer are also working on a Roman series that will likely land at HBO.

[22:59:49] Comment: dz1c612 by OtherwisePlatypus : > the way government spending works (and I assume large companies too, but the government makes this especially true) is that for a transaction to be made, that money must pass through like 30 accounts before it gets to it's destination (where it might just sit and then be rerouted somewhere else later, repeating the process). Now, if I mistake is made like it got fat fingered and it's a dollar off, that entire process must be undone, all of the money, not just what is wrong. For every $1 you accounted for incorrectly (read: NOT LOST) you now have $30 in errors.

 please provide a source that shows government spending requires juggling "like 30" accounts and that somehow moving money from account to account costs the government money? Why must the "entire process" be "undone"? That is not how most organizations nor transactions function.  I'm skeptical of your knowledge of accounting.

I think the general meta point you're making is true, I don't disagree with that, I just think your coloration of "government spending" is a little unfair and embellished. Which isn't much of a surprise given what sub we're in. posted to submission: The $21 trillion in lost defense spending

**Overall Episode Thoughts**  

Today introduced Hotaru and Natsumi interactions! It was really nice to see Natsumi show off how knowledgeable she is at things that she likes doing in comparison to school which she dislikes. The firefly segment was a really nice finish to the episode, and also had a ton of beautiful shots. [See you tomorrow~](https://i.imgur.com/IspDafi.png)

So you start by saying "who am I to judge your sin" then proceed to judge what you consider a sin. Hell, even saying "who am I to judge your sin" starts with a judgement, since you've already declared something a sin before you even start.

Making a College of Swords Bard; they can use a melee weapon as a spellcasting focus.  Using two-weapon fighting the Swords Bard doesn't have a "free hand" for somatic spellcasting, but for material spellcasting the PHB states that you can use the same hand for material and somatic components, which would be the melee weapon.  Does this mean a dual-wielding Swords Bard can cast spells with both Material and Somatic components, but not a spell that is only Somatic (Verbal notwithstanding)? posted to submission: Weekly Questions Thread #157

What kind of monster condemns an innocent, valuable human being to a life where they're resented by the people who should love them unconditionally? Why would you punish the child when the parents *know* they can't properly take care of the child? Because that's what you're doing. You would rather condemn millions of innocents to a short, brutal, miserable life that they wish they'd never been born into.

[23:05:07] Comment: dz1cf4u by Simkins1050 : Again he isn‚Äôt talking about Christ. He should be telling you that you will be beheaded for your faith as a sacrifice after the oblation is stopped by Christ to establish his covenant with the Jewish people. Heaven is in Jerusalem and we come back with Jesus. The details are intentionally left out. He wants you to take the ‚Äúmark of God‚Äù it surely won‚Äôt be called the mark of the beast. We are only months away from the 3rd Temple being built. He should also tell you we are in the tribulations. He would be immediately fired. 

But God has some good stuff coming to pull the rug out from these ‚Äúworld leaders‚Äù  and Satan. 

That‚Äôs why Trump made Jerusalem the capital.

[23:05:08] Comment: dz1cf4w by softcrime : My first memory of experiencing the void was as a child, probably around 2-3 years old. I‚Äôd just sit on my bed, close my eyes, and access it, the vast abyss of nothingness... I‚Äôd travel through it, sometimes coming across different colored 2D planes, focusing in on them, and receiving ideas of completely different worlds/modes of existence. I loved that place, it was so peaceful and comfortable. 

One day, I recall my mom knocking on the door to tell me dinner was ready. I was instantly sucked out of this void and opened my eyes. It took me a couple of minutes to register what ‚Äúdinner,‚Äù ‚Äúfamily,‚Äù ‚Äúmom,‚Äù and ‚Äúroom,‚Äù meant before settling back into the present and assuming my role as a human child. Thinking about it now sends chills down my spine. 

That was the last time I remember interacting with the void‚Äîas in, fully immersing myself within it, so deep that I‚Äôd lose my current identity and attachments to Earth in it. I wonder how it would feel now... would it be serene and wondrous, as it was when I was a child? Or have I been too conditioned in fear to openly embrace it? 

I hope to find out. posted to submission: Has anyone ever experienced the Black Void when dreaming? Holy crap, I just had my first experience...

[23:05:55] Comment: dz1clq7 by THEdopealope : ah I gotcha. Fender had planned to release a guitar in the 70's that had all the pups hidden under the guard, which might work here with high output pups, just some sidebar info if you're interested in pursuing that. 

But amongst what you've listed, I think it would be cool if you could figure out how to wire a setting where tone pot cuts highs or lows (probably highs, as they usually cut the low right? I'm a lil rusty). idk how that work here though, maybe you can figure something out! 

Another opinion: idk if I personally would expend the effort to set up a standard volume & tone setting on a switch position b/c ultimately you can do that without a switch, and you're essentially wasting a position ‚Äì¬†UNLESS ‚Äì it's a boost. Then you could sail through the solos.

Anyways, that's my 2 cents. Beautiful guitar again, good luck with any project you take on!   posted to submission: Posted pic in r/guitars. Someone asked a question that got me thinking.

Yes.  You seem to want compensation for what you did.  Instead they are inviting you to be an investor.  That doesn't sound like what you want.

>Why are options more appropriate here?

Because options, when properly administered, pose no tax consequences unless and until you exercise and sell them.  So you haven't paid taxes on receiving actual shares of the company at $0 or a lower than fair market value (which is immediately taxable).  Do you really want to be stuck holding that bag should the company fail?  And it's likely they will based on the statistics. posted to submission: Is Restricted Stock typically granted or purchased?

[23:06:26] Comment: dz1clqz by Poptech : There are two distinct parts of your Ancestry Composition Report:

1. 31 "Population labels" based on more accurate and vetted reference populations that include a specific percentage.
2. 120 "Recent Ancestor Locations" based on self-reported customer data from the 23andme Family Origins survey that is crowd-sourced. These include the countries and dots that may appear below the percentages.

These have nothing to do with each other and the percentage assigned to the first cannot be carried over to the second. 23andme will misleadingly only list a single country on the main Ancestry Composition Report when you may have more than one country you match with per region.

[23:08:54] Comment: dz1crnz by Mithridates12 : Yeah, it was a bit clumsy with the flashback, which I feel is kind of the easy way out and doesn't entirely fit the show. However, it gives you the opportunity to be very clear in your explanations in a short amount of time as you can tell and show what is/was happening. They didn't use that technique to its full potential because as you said, it still was a bit confusing. 

That said, I'm not sure they want to explain everything. I think we are used to crime dramas that neatly wrap everything up and LoD doesn't seem to go that route (maybe S3 offers some explanations, I haven't started it yet). If this is intentional, I would've preferred if they had a scene where one of the protagonists ask something that we don't and they acknowledge that even though the case is solved, not everything is known or makes sense to them.   posted to submission: Season 2 questions (SPOILERS)

You're projecting my friend. You can't handle that you lost our discussion earlier and you've shut down any attempts at having a conversation that involves your actual thoughts and feelings. Once again, that inadequacy and frustration you feel must be why you take it out physically on your wife, with your poor impulse control. We've been going back an forth for a week and you haven't given a clear justification for any of your opinions. What does that say about your self esteem or your mental state?

[23:12:08] Comment: dz1czr1 by Geek_reformed : It is a pretty widely known issue around who actually created those Silver Age characters like Spider-Man and The Fantastic Four.

It seems to have been a collaborative process between Stan Lee and the likes Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, but there are claims that they did more of the creative work than Lee.

To some extent, it is down to the Marvel Method in which Stan would give the artists a general plot, they would go off and draw the comic and he'd then produce the script based off want the artist had produced. Although Jack Kirby has previously stated he did all the work and Stan took the credit for the writing.

This is an interview with Jack Kirby in which he put forward his memories of working with Stan Lee - http://www.tcj.com/jack-kirby-interview/5/.

I am not saying that Stan deserves to be treated like this in his old age, just that there has been a lot of controversy about how be got be the Stan the Man. posted to submission: [Stan Lee] Help!

[23:12:21] Comment: dz1czr6 by iggyiggz1999 : >The Goal explosions should be set up by rank as well

I completely disagree about this. You already have the rank specific rewards in this case the banners. (I mean banners aren't great in general IMO but any item in this case could work) In any previous season you would have only had these banners.

Now they added something extra. Its more divided into the general low, med, high ranks and I think thats a good idea. It gives people in diamond (Still only like a small percentage of players) something for, well, high up players.

Also making the explosions also different per rank I feel it would give the champs too much exclusive stuff. posted to submission: In Regards to the Season Rewards

The dynasty's are cool to see and it's fun watching a young team piece it together and become competitive so it's always fun to see a new team win. Before the warriors got their first they were one of the teams that no one would ever think would win it so their run is special especially since they really built this team through the draft and added through free agency which has been the blueprint for many teams. posted to submission: Grizzled NBA fans who watched the past dominant dynasties (Showtime Lakers, Jordan's Bulls, early 2000s Lakers), during the peak of their dynasty was there the same sense of boring inevitably that they were basically going to easily march their way to a one-sided Finals win like the KD-Warriors?

* IOTA does machine-to-machine transactions but so far we only have a demo electric car charger.

Those are good coins which I hold in the hope that they will live up to their expectations. But it's all speculation isn't it? Even these top-tier coins.

With the armor, the weapons become balanced, but without it, just adding the weapons only, they'll demolish vanilla gear easily.

Similarly, there are some races that have like 500 HP limbs and are virtually undefeatable even in a 50v1 battle, unless you're using a sniper rifle that hits for 1000.

**Best**: Toss up between [Love Scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heIvcW7nw5U) and [Bling Bling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT6H8Qs1Tsc). I love the simplicity and sharpness of the LS choreography. As for Bling Bling, the reason I like it is because it has a strong hip hop vibe which the members are able to pull off so effortlessly. Both are quite different from one another but are both fun to watch.

**Worst**: [Rhythm Ta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4mgw8AcwL8). The choreography is pretty lazy - which isn't totally a bad thing since I think it suits the song itself. However, there's just nothing interesting or eye catching about it. 

GFriend:

**Best** - [Rough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbpyd-D4PI). Truly their best choreography. It's what got me into GFriend in the first place. It's just so beautiful and pleasing to watch.

**Worst** - [Navillera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5yIqiYiMI). There are some cool moves, like the opening where the members start in a line and disperse - but everything from then on is kinda plain and boring to watch until it gets to the signature GFriend dance break (which I love!). posted to submission: With your favorite group/s which is your best/worst title track choreography?

Your article aside, I have worked on tailings remediation personally. Essentially a 4 billion project that uses flocculation and centrifuges to clean up the tailings ponds!

This project doesn't *make* us any money. We're doing it because it's the right thing to do. I'm also quite proud to have been a part of this environmental initiative. One of many.


See, I think you, OP, have us pegged as a bunch of backwards rednecks with no regard for the environment. Which really sucks, because there are many, like me, who want a global shift to renewables. This takes time.

In the interim, the flood of biased misinformation looming on social media is heavy. 

I'm not trying to bust your chops here btw. Just figured I'd give you some perspective from my experience.

Any good player is gonna rip your head off if your sitting there spamming mini gun. It's only useful in squads and even then, If someone is mini gunning me, it's my first target cause it's an easy kill.

[23:23:37] Comment: dz1dq5l by Orwellian1 : But sociology is arguably a field where *everything* affects everything else in a material way. Lifestyle, luxury, economic status all impact relationships between groups. I don't see how it can be useful to use a social or economic category that is becoming less relevant. Why handicap the field by trying to fit contemporary social relationships into categories that were formed during a different paradigm? If nothing else, the categories of "worker" and "owner" are getting smaller and more muddy. 

I just can't think of another field of science that tries to hold on to existing conventions that seriously. 

I don't want to sound confrontational. I am really curious. Is there an easy to explain reason why it is better to use a Marxist category as opposed to establishing a more comprehensive and modern system?

[23:24:41] Comment: dz1dq69 by Noobasdfjkl : >The Escape outsold the Fusion, and the Taurus last year.

Very true, but this could be easily explained by Ford not giving a single shit about the Taurus since 2013. I don't know if full-size sedans have much of a place in the American market, but for god's sake, the Taurus is less roomy than the Fusion is. 

Ford has tried a little harder with the Fusion, but Ford literally just got their infotainment game together with Sync 3. I'm not exactly sure why the Fusion isn't able to get better fuel economy, but I'm sure the marginal difference between the Fusion and the Escape mpgs isn't helping.

>I also think Ford still does plenty for the enthusiast

[23:25:19] Comment: dz1dq6x by LeCrushinator : And if the labor market demands $30/hour for fruit picking, farmers would need to pass those costs on to us, which in turn would likely result in increased imports of those foods from other countries. The free market can't have it both ways, they need to either reduce costs, or increase imports from places with lower costs. Cheaper immigrant labor addresses the issue somewhat. But if Americans think that kicking the illegal immigrants out is going to result in them having more jobs that they're willing to work, then I've got a bridge to sell them. posted to submission: Xenophobic Rage Barbie just likes to have fun!

If I've already paid for a game then I'm not going to pay for a *chance* to get something that I want.  I fondly remember growing and *gasp* unlocking characters and maps!  I get that costs have increased but lootboxes are an absolutely horribly consumer unfriendly way to go about making that money back. 

In any case Overwatch doesn't currently have characters and maps in the lootboxes so why would they have you pay for them individually after?  You're making it sound like they would lose all monetization avenues if they just let people pay directly for the skins, voice clips, and emotes that they want and that they'd be *forced* to go back to a system that fractured player bases.  I highly doubt it's as black and white as you're making it out to be.  They might not make as much money, since people wouldn't be pumping quarters into this system like a slot machine, but they'd still be making a lot. posted to submission: Ready At Dawn (The Order 1886) hiring for a "Systems/Monetization Designer" for their next AAA console game.

[23:28:16] Comment: dz1e04k by HerraTohtori : Fuel lines aren't visible but they might actually be modeled because sometimes a hit in the engine area gives you a fuel leak without visible damage on your actual fuel tanks.

In general I tend to agree though, War Thunder is not complicated enough to justify wanting every component and rivet modeled in the damage model.

However, it *would* be appropriate to have the really important power unit components modeled so that damage to them would cause realistic loss of performance.

Another good example would be early P-38 wings, which contained the intercoolers for the aircraft's turbosupercharger system. Perforated wings should by all rights lead to a loss of manifold pressure on the relevant engine. Later P-38 models (I think P-38J model and later) moved the intercooler to be seated under the engine, which made it less exposed at the cost of slight drag increase.

Like you said, it's fine by me if Gaijin doesn't want to implement non-critical components like hydraulics or pneumatics/electrics for fire control, depending on whether the aircraft used pneumatically or electrically actuated gun triggers.

But something that has an immediate effect on aircraft's performance really kind of should be included in the damage model. posted to submission: Reminder the P-47's Turbosupercharger is Completely MISSING from the Damage Model.

[23:28:20] Comment: dz1e04n by WineberryOverGold : This is such horse shit.

Price did not get CT from a Fortnite addiction, and he's only hanging up his controller around the club house so the media cant take this story any further.

She knows it was wrong, it was a long time ago, she‚Äôs apologized many times over the years, and she‚Äôs accepted responsibility. 

I know she tweeted All Lives Matter the other day, but based on the context, and on her reaction when people filled her in afterward- she didn‚Äôt mean anything shitty, and she knows now that ALM is an anti-BLM slogan. 

I mean, I‚Äôm not saying we should all got on the Eureka train, I think these mistakes make it clear she has some work to do and some things to learn.

And this is the first you‚Äôve heard of it in two years. You married the WRONG one. Why the fuck would she tell you this AFTER you got married? Couples are supposed to set boundaries as they learn about one another; what you approve of (like can we fuck other people, can we go on dates with other people, can we experiment with the same sex, etc.), and even go to marriage counseling to figure out their compatibility before marriage. You need to get out. There is no talking. She obviously is miserable and doesn‚Äôt want this for herself. She doesn‚Äôt want to settle down. There is no saving this marriage, there is no ‚Äúgetting it out of her system‚Äù. Get WHAT out of your system? If she‚Äôs addicted to sex, there IS NO GETTING IT OUT OF HER SYSTEM? Do NOT be na√Øve. You‚Äôre 21, I‚Äôm 17. I am supposed to be na√Øve. I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm genuinely offended by her words and actions. I‚Äôm a girl, and I know I would lie to not be alone, and I would hide the truth to keep someone I care about. I don‚Äôt know if she loves your or cares about you or not, but it kinda sounds like she‚Äôs losing feelings. 
She did not leave her home, her husband, her kid... to meet up with a guy for a fucking kiss. If she is addicted to sex, sex is what happened. And I doubt she would‚Äôve cared if he‚Äôs autistic if she didn‚Äôt know that at the time.  posted to submission: Wife wants to sleep with other people.

[23:30:10] Comment: dz1e5iq by random043 : >Which gender is socialized into which sectors at a young age and then which sectors are more highly valued throughout society?

From how your comment is written I assume you have a strong opinion on this, but I am not even sure how you could quantify something like that, not to even talk about  how to measure it.

>Are women encouraged to negotiate better salaries or are they punished for it as opposed to when men do the same thing?

Certainly an interesting topic, assuming it is true in the first place (it likely is), it would be interesting to hear some arguments how much comes down to nature or nurturing.

>Who does the child rearing? Why are so many Swiss women willing to leave the workforce for years on end in order to raise kids? Are their husbands unwilling?

Evolutionary biology explains this pretty well and plausibly.

>Is childcare too expensive?

Well, this is a nice can of worms you opened there. posted to submission: Swiss Earnings Structure Survey in 2016

[23:30:14] Comment: dz1e5is by Hagenaar : This could have several contributing factors. We know that exercise alone does not make us fit and strong. We need to add recovery. That's when the muscles get stronger. Exercise with inadequate rest eventually breaks us down. Work rest intervals are less than ideal if the work is five or more days per week.  

Based on my experience on construction sites, the very concept of a healthy lifestyle seems foreign to many manual laborers. Smoking, heavy drinking, poor diets seem more common than among other professionals I've observed. Perhaps the connection between the two is lower education levels. posted to submission: Exercise is good for you ‚Äì unless it's part of your job: scientists find physically demanding jobs are linked to greater risk of early death

Plenty of women are only into masculine dudes. People have types. You like what you like, and that's really all there is to it. There's no sense trying to figure out why you are the way you are \(I mean, unless you really want to\), because there's no guarantee that you'll get answers that are reliable and concrete.

I think it makes total sense, actually, and lots of other bi guys are the same way. I personally don't have a preference one way or the other, but I'm only like, 15&#37; into dudes, and that's usually just related to sex.

This is nonsense. One doesn't need to imagine that human beings are property to conceive of moral systems where it is wrong to harm them. Humans don't own themselves because they aren't owned by *anyone.*

> But we obviously know you have the exclusive right to our bodies bc we have the exclusive control over it.

We do not. I can grab your arm and twist it in a way you don't want it to be twisted. I can insert electrodes into your brain and force you to move it with your own muscles. We do not have exclusive control over them. 

Besides the fact that owning our bodies wouldn't mean we have exclusive control, it would mean that we *should.* Owning something doesn't mean that someone can't take it from you. They still *can.* It just means society agrees that they *shouldn't,* and that they should be punished if they do. So your logic doesn't connect. Your conclusion does not follow.

> From this we can conclude we own our bodies

Or that no one does.

I don't appreciate the personal attacks.  Calling me a racist with zero proof is beyond the pale.

>> You want black people to stop being killed by the police, get them to stop shooting and robbing people at such disproportionate rates
>
>The "disproportionate rates" is where I extrapolated out the "likely" as it's implied because he's claiming that people of color commit crimes at a different rate than white people.

Blacks are six times more likely to be the victims of homicide.  Is that also a "racist statistic?"

Men commit a higher percentage of murders than women do.  Men are more likely to be arrested and go to jail than women?  Does saying that also make me a sexist?  

>This was his defense to me pointing out that cops still kill minorities at a higher rate and that's not okay. His defense to this was to trot out the racists favorite old "well if they didn't do x then this wouldn't happen" which ignores than in identical situations with white people the person more often isn't shot.

Men are killed by police at a higher rate.  Does that make me a sexist for saying so?  Would saying "well if men didn't commit so many murders then they wouldn't be arrested or shot by police more often" also make me a sexist or no?

If not why not?

>It's a racist justification for why the cops are shooting more people of color.

This was one of the primary arguments that led to the Roe vs. Wade decision. Fetuses cannot live outside the womb. Fetuses don't become legal people until they are born. They are part of the mother. Legally, this is settled.

> You‚Äôre deliberately blowing past the entire argument to spout off simple truths that everyone agrees on like that women have a right to their own bodies. It‚Äôs the little human inside that I care about not being slaughtered for convenience. 

This argument relies on the fetus being a sentient human that can feel and think and be biologically deserving of ethical consideration. [It's impossible for fetuses to feel pain < 24 weeks](https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/rcogfetalawarenesswpr0610.pdf), and [they are kept sedated/unconscious until born by chemicals in the womb until first breath.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/) They are not sentient before birth. Medically and biologically, this is settled.

> You were either deliberately being ignorant to the argument or really just haven‚Äôt thought out the argument at all.

The rational course of action is to believe some anonymous and unidentified person who posted a document on the internet two decades ago, which shows the CIA discussing to cover up how they were behind the entire thing.

And the fact that I've shown the document is a clumsy forgery? Well, that's just even more proof of the conspiracy, isn't it.

They produced a genuine record, designed to look fake, just in case it ever leaked, and then someone stole the original of that document from the National Archives and posted it on the internet, which is why there is no trace of it in the JFK collection!

In fact he would flash out when he lost a quarter hp and left. I tried and tried to split and told my team to keep them from recalling at first they were like "yeah we got u" then they gave up. Needless to say I became useless rather early in the game which lasted over an hour because my teammates didn't coordinate made poorly times baron and elder calls and over all didn't do good at all in the sense of teamwork and the right objective and yes I've used you as a rant xD posted to submission: What qualifies as an S+?

[23:38:06] Comment: dz1ek4u by ThirdTurnip : They relaxed the limited time aspect of the weekend events. So theoretically a new player can catch up. It's possible they might eventually extend that to ships.

Like the weekend ones, make ship event voucher cooldown account wide rather than character (to prevent altaholics from being able to get every former ship from one event) and allow maybe enough for 1.5 ships every event.

That would theoretically allow new players to eventually catch up, would allow players to get specific older ships which they might prefer, and wouldn't make phoenix-box acquired ships completely worthless. posted to submission: Breen ships, possible event re-run?
[23:38:07] Comment: dz1ek4v by fire-the-assholes : > you are trying to claim that men are faultless.

nowhere did i say men are faultless.  quite the opposite.  i literally stated...

> yes, **it's still mainly the cheater's fault for cheating** but a spouse (husband or wife) who cuts off sex is always partially to blame

and 

> **he still carries the bulk of the blame**, but she's still not faultless

the second you step into the realm of marriage + children, both spouses are morally at fault for any destruction of the family unit.

it's like if a child crosses the road without looking both ways and gets hit.  sure, the car driver is legally at fault, but morally the kid is still partially at fault because they did something stupid that was entirely preventable. posted to submission: Dear single mothers, this is not what we want to hear when we ask about your employment.

From a business standpoint, I can see why they chose DaS1, it was far more popular/profitable so it has more name recognition and it's multi\-platform meaning more potential buyers.

DaS1 was a great game, I sunk upwards of 1000 hours into it, but a remaster doesn't excite me in the least.  I find the mechanics of DS far more interesting and worthy of a remaster. posted to submission: Remaster Discussion Mega-Thread

[23:39:43] Comment: dz1eqrf by zondo23 : As long as you ordered the item you wanted and they sent the incorrect item they should be responsible completely for return postage. Anything other then that is poor customer service. Honestly, I think you should name the company. I would prefer to avoid a company that treats it‚Äôs customers like this. And since they most likely have a presence on reddit it would give them the opportunity to explain their side of the story. This could very well be one employee‚Äôs poor choice on how to handle the situation. I understand your reluctance to name the company, but I think at the very least you should try to contact someone higher up then customer service and let them know.  posted to submission: DE razor company unhappy experience.
[23:39:43] Comment: dz1eqrg by FedishSwish : I disagree with the shooting people comment, but I completely agree with the leniency, both culturally and from an enforcement perspective. I was biking to work today and saw a cyclist run a red light directly in front of a cop car and...nothing. Cyclist continues unhindered and is further justified.

I will add, though, that cyclists also put up with a lot of shit from other road users. Pedestrians walk into bike lanes without looking, cars turn left without looking, bike lanes are blocked, etc. Cars present a greater risk for pedestrians and cyclists than cyclists present for pedestrians. posted to submission: What Would You Improve About Biking In The City?

[23:40:07] Comment: dz1eqrs by BomptonBrotha88 : Your "boundaries" were insufficient and likely to encourage this behavior, and after all this if you tell him that you'll "never be able to fulfill this with him" he'll likely  break up with you. If you're this jealous about the prospect of your boyfriend's involvement in making this 3 way happen then you should think long and hard before talking about this with your next boyfriend. If you do split up take a break from dating and having sex for a minute and reevaluate what you really want from a relationship and what you need physically/emotionally/spiritually/etc. You've sent that man some very mixed signals after a drunk and horny one off romp with a mutual friend that you initiated. The banter between your boyfriend and other acquaintance/friend is absolutely working up to a fuck session though, whether you are involved or not, so if you do want to try a FFM sexual encounter you may as well do it and then break up with your man so you can know for sure if it's a thing you actually enjoy vs a thing you fantasize about enjoying(there is often a big difference). Making this a learning experience can help you grow as a person and help you get past the painful parts. Good luck, and please give an update when possible. posted to submission: My boyfriend tried to set up a threesome in our house without me knowing. I need some advice.

[23:40:13] Comment: dz1eqrw by hambre_sensorial : I guess it depends on the time you go to the gym, the important thing is to clean the sweat and do it as soon as possible as it can be pretty drying. Personally, I just use TO Hyaluronic Acid because I workout around 10-11 am, so I already did my morning routine. I would use something light but hydrating enough, just to compensate the washing and that's pretty much it. Or you could follow your normal routine if it fits.

[23:40:56] Comment: dz1eqsj by SarcasticDom : "Lord Roote called his allies under false pretenses, but when I found out the truth I sent orders to recall my troops. Granted, Manfryd refused but that was him." Alester flared up in anger. "The Mootons attacked my people, they killed my people! They acted recklessly; if they had thought to wait, to allow diplomacy, then those innocent smallfolk may still be alive. To those deaths rest on my brother's shoulders? Most definitely, but it was Mooton steel that ended those lives. And now you reward that recklessness with lands to their vassals? You set a dangerous precedent, my Lord."

Alester knew he should hold his tongue, but enough was enough. He had been spat upon and insulted and laughed at for too long. "I have been a loyal vassal, a loyal man, my entire life. I have always offered you and your grandfather fair council. When Frey and Mallister where at one another's throats, I remained uninvolved. When Frey found himself isolated from the Riverlands after the Paege debacle, I helped him reintegrate.

[23:42:15] Comment: dz1ew29 by zebulonworkshops : Not so much myself, but I take deep pride in how proud my mom is in telling the stories about me in fifth grade baseball. I had three feats: 1) While pitching I had a big, slow, looping curve, eventually that was a big fat homerun pitch, but early on it was amazing, and I had a batter fall backwards trying to avoid a pitch and instead took a called strike three. 2) By no means fast, I once got so annoyed at third base that the pitcher started using his slow, full wind up, despite me running halfway home and stomping, so I got the go-ahead and stole home. I got there before the ball and even the umpire was surprised. 3) And finally, that was the first year you could steal or, as a catcher, pick off runners. So I did. Picked a girl off at first when she kept lagging getting back to the bag. She cried the whole way back to the bench. My mom never leaves off that final detail. I love that woman.

As for CoD vs Raines, you're biasing it towards one particular run. Not everyone will sub 30 Magicites or content of that sort in their first attempt, but with that being the goal to aim for, CoD's party doom is ultimately less of an issue, and in fact an asset for Darkness based parties that need a Doom source but are short of skill slots/hones on the inflictors. posted to submission: Analysis of Acolyte Archive selection

Also for tactics.  Don't just run out in the open while firing on the move.  Moving and shooting isn't like a video game, and is way less accurate.  Run to a corner, do a quick peek \(either with gun raised or not\) to gather information.  Peeking a corner without your gun raised is much faster than with your gun raised, but obviously you can't fire immediately.  In airsoft, BBs have a slow travel time, so you can peek for free without getting hit, if you do it quickly. posted to submission: Looking for Gameplay tips and tricks for a new player.

You mean it's not being given the significance you think it out to have. Because it's a nationalist grievance you wish everyone was getting really worked up about.

[23:43:41] Comment: dz1ew3h by makeswell2 : well, one thing you can try is [/r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions)I'm a software developer and I know people who sell products. The sales culture can be a lot different from the software culture in that sales can be kind of a selfish act. Some car salespeople I know will essentially lie to the customers to get them to buy certain things. I'm just saying. You kind of have to have a selfish interest in those industries. It's part of the role. Anyways, I'm sure there are lots of opinions and different kinds of sales jobs out there, that's just my rant.It's cool you like learning new softwares. You should take an intro to computer science course and see how you like writing code. College is largely for experimenting and taking courses to see what you like, anyways. There are also a lot of jobs out there for "front end developers" or "UI/UX designers". There is a UI/UX designer who works with my team who got a bachelor's degree in UI/UX design. I mention the UI/UI and front end thing because you are interested in design and technology, and there is a role out there which combines the two.

I recommend reading the "Occupational Outlook Handbook" to everyone trying to plan the start of their career. It's really trustworthy since it's published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and is available online for free. Just google "Occupational Outlook Handbook" and click the first link. You'll be able to see a bunch of different types of jobs, how to get them, how well they compensate, and what the average day\-to\-day of those jobs is.

[23:44:15] Comment: dz1ew3w by bruvar : Churn in the industry tends to be very low, as it is expensive (often prohibitively so) to leave a service and there are costs to starting a new service. 

As soon as a new company comes to build their network, everyone in that footprint gets a renewal offer from the incumbent for $20 less than their current plan with a nice two year contract. Then once the new company can offer service it's a few hundred dollars to cancel the contract and switch over, you have to really impress these people and offer a huge value to get over that hump.

[23:44:48] Comment: dz1f3a2 by PsychoRecycled : I can't remember the exact issue, but somewhere in War Journal Volume 2, there's someone in SHIELD talking to GW Bridge, and they say something like, 'y'know, Green Goblin keeps breaking out of jail and killing people - at what point does Spiderman have blood on his hands for not killing him when he's had so many opportunities?'

That isn't a trivial question. The clear-cut answer isn't 'killing is always wrong'. 

Punisher overcorrects pretty hard on the whole murder thing, but if you want more people telling Frank to fuck himself, then if you're going to be consistent, I think you should want more people taking more responsibility for the fact that their nemesis keep racking up serious body counts, and changing their tactics/actions accordingly. 

IMO, there's *need* for neither - the same suspension of disbelief that lets us ignore how many innocent lives various heroes are responsible for without any serious change on their part simultaneously lets us buy into the idea that Punisher only kills people who have it coming, to at least some extent, and never, ever, hurts innocents.  posted to submission: Damn Bucky you didn't have to do that (Original Sin #4)

[23:46:17] Comment: dz1f3b3 by wdmartin : Just a shout out for [Arcane Blast](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedPlayersGuide/advancedFeats.html#Arcane-Blast) from the APG.  It lets you sack a spell slot for a ray that does 2d6 damage plus 1d6 per spell level (e.g. 3d6 for a first level spell, 4d6 for a second level spell, etc).  This is very good for an Arcane Trickster for three reasons:

1. It's a ray, so you can sneak attack with it.
2. The damage *does not have a type*, which means it bypasses energy resistances and immunities.
3. It's a SU ability [per the FAQ](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fn#v5748eaic9oao), which means it bypasses spell resistance.

It's solid, reliable damage for opponents with annoying energy resistances or SR.  The added sneak attack dice make it much better. posted to submission: Best 3 Metamagic Feats for an Arcane Trickster

This is a *WILD* mis-characterization.  Like, holy crap.  Israel is attempting a "systemic extermination"?  You're joking, right?

In the last 20 years or so, there have been approximately 7,000 Palestinian deaths at the hands of the Israeli military.  Out of a population of about 4.1 million.  And you're equating that number to 6 million deaths?

In yesterday's "protest" specifically, there were somewhere around 20,000-30,000 people at the border.  Of those, about 40 were killed.  Considering Israel's total tactical superiority in terms of arms, if they were going for  "extermination" it is perhaps the most incompetent attempt in military history.

Or maybe, just maybe, that's not what they are doing at all? posted to submission: The great evangelical silence: What the church should say about Gaza

My mother was working at Jamba juice, back then it was Zuka juice. They had a promotion going where you would get a free smoothie if you purchased a reusable cup. They had an entire wall with shelving full of these cups, and you would just grab one down and purchase it then get your smoothie. A customer grabbed one of the cups from the wall, and walked to the register to place their order. My mom was not working the register, but she was present when this occurred. The woman at the register rang up the order, opened the cup to begin making his smoothie, and then she let out a scream. Somebody had taken the cup into the bathroom and taken a shit in it and then replaced it on the shelf.

So if you had a 2 conference, four division league. 1st in CA vs 2nd in CB & 1st in CB vs 2nd in CA would be the qualifying finals. The four division runner ups would then duke it out to get into the Semis.

[23:49:26] Comment: dz1fbc3 by HawkI84 : Oban is one of the original six classic malts, and as such, gets the same boring lineup the others do - which includes a ‚ÄúDistillers Edition‚Äù, which undergo an additional finishing maturation in some sort of sherry or wine cask. This one gets some extra time in Montilla Fino casks, and is bottled at 43% abv and 15 years of age. Thanks to u/milites1979.

**Nose** - Honey, orange zest, lots of dried ginger and black pepper, light smoke, toasty vanilla pound cake. Fairly mild, but nice.

**Palate** - Very easygoing - honey, orange zest, a bit of dried ginger, vanilla, toasted white bread, a hint of pepper. Nicely melded and balanced, but could use some more weight...it‚Äôs a bit too ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù.

**Finish** - A bit sea-salty here, with the honey, orange zest, vanilla, black pepper, a hint of smoke, and dried ginger.

This is...pretty good. It‚Äôs perfectly pleasant, there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúoff‚Äù about it, it just kind of leaves me wanting a bit more, like everything else Oban puts out. I‚Äôd love to try the 21 year at cask strength, but I‚Äôm not gonna pay Special Release prices for it. I‚Äôm more than happy to have some if u/dlofx offers me a pour, but for $80+ I‚Äôm going to look for something a bit more interesting. One nice thing about this is that the Montilla finish melds seamlessly with the whisky, unlike some other DE‚Äôs where the finish seems to mask what‚Äôs going on a bit much (Clynelish).

For this to mean anything, you'd need to compare the int % and Wonderlic scores of all the other starting QB's from that time period. I'm sure that graph would be an absolute mess. posted to submission: Tyrod Taylor has the 2nd best INT rate of any QB over last 3 years; Ryan Fitzpatrick has the worst INT rate of any QB over last 3 years.

Walking away not looking back... yeah.  I know that feeling.  Heck, I took a break from PvZ 2 for awhile, too.  If this stops being fun, I'd do it again.

[23:51:18] Comment: dz1fhbt by SvedishFish : Yes, this is very true. A hangover is about 90% dehydration. You can trust me, I've studied Drunk Science (that's the science of getting drunk, not regular science while drunk).  

That crushing headache you have in the morning? That's a lack of hydration causing your brain to temporarily contract/shrink. This pulls on the membranes that attach it to your skull which in turn makes you feel like your head is in a vice. 

Drinking plenty of water helps a lot, but won't fully counter a night of serious binge drinking. I recommend Adult Electrolytes, available at any local CVS or Walgreens. It's mostly the same stuff as Pedialyte except made for old people and alcoholics. Get a bottle of that, drink some before you start drinking and a lot more before you go to sleep, and you'll be amazed at how not-shitty you feel the next day.

[23:51:48] Comment: dz1fhc2 by slicklikeagato : Quick question. Here is my code snippet:

    #!/usr/local/bin/python3

    from glob import glob
    import json
    import psycopg2


    conn = psycopg2.connect('dbname=tweet_history')
    curr = conn.cursor()

    for filename in glob('*.json'):
        with open(filename) as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            for i in data:
##            print(i['text'])
                curr.execute("INSERT INTO finally VALUES (%s, %s, %s);",
                         (i['text'], i['id_str'], i['created_at']))
            
    conn.commit()
        
When I uncomment `print(I['text'])`, the code runs fine, and prints everything to my terminal; however, when I instead run the `curr.execute` block, I get a `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` error.

I really have no way of finding out which of these caused this error that I know of (trying to parse 16k tweets). Would you have any idea how/why this error pops up when trying to add the info to the database?

[23:51:51] Comment: dz1fhc5 by grill-chz : The Light Assault is the anti-vehicle infantry role.. why would we nerf the class to such an extent? Are you implying they are *too good* at their role? If that's the case, then we need to nerf some other classes too.

Why are vehicle players and their role in the vehicle/anti-vehicle dynamic not held responsible for decisions they make (load out composition, positioning, awareness etc)? 

>2 C4 and 2 clips of rocklet is enough to kill most sunderers too, and it shouldnt require a specific defence slot choice (deployment shield/composite armor) just to protect from a singular attack by a singular unchallenged LA

Yes it should. Full stop. The deploy shield specifically exists to be the AMS.. the 'deploy' Sundie. Each type of Sundie build has it's own purpose. If you bring the wrong type of Sundie, for example a repair Sundie or an ammo Sundie, and try to use it as your spawn point, that's on YOU. You did it wrong. You can't call for a nerf on a class based on wrong decisions made by the players.

A full deploy shield Sundie takes 5(!) rocklet barrages and 2 C4 to kill.. that's a *hell* of a lot of time, and if that Sundie is being defended, like it should be, then there's very little chance a lone LA will be successful. Take it from the guy who has grown a reputation for being the Sundie killer on Connery. 

Sundies *are* vital to an attacking team, so it is upon them to protect that thing like the success of their attack depends on it - *because it does*. This is good and multifaceted game play and this dynamic needs to be protected/preserved. We should *not* be making or even thinking of Sundies as fire and forget items.. you *HAVE* to protect them.. it's a big part of the game :] posted to submission: What if LA could only hold 1 C4

Also, snarky is my thing. 

To counter your point though, what makes you think that a corporation would be in control of an infinite source of power?  If its infinite, then it essentially becomes valueless because everyone can have as much as they want without end.  

You ate assuming that...
1)Corporations are inherently evil. 
2)Corporations will somehow obtain this energy and enslave mankind
3) Governments, by extension, are benevolent.
4) People will continue to operate as usual, even though our most precious resource we strive for is energy, and the structure of society would not change if we had an unlimited source of this power. 
5)We will be SO short sighted that other goals that are currently unfeasible now, due to lack of an infinite power source, would not be sought after.

[23:53:41] Comment: dz1fhdj by MrBojangles528 : Hey man, I'm totally with you - the Republicans should take a *huge* amount of blame for the election! I think, again, the Russia narrative takes focus away from the other problems you mention, and many more that led to the GOP nominating and electing Donald Trump. It definitely looks like Russia was involved in the election, but to what extent is not currently known. All I'm saying is that we should wait until the investigation is finished before we make judgements about the impact they had on the election. 

The corruption I am referring to is how the media colluded with the Hillary campaign to discredit and smear Bernie. There are copious amounts of emails showing this corruption plain as day; if you haven't seen these by now you must have chosen not to follow them as they were released. 

There are tons of articles about the issue, such as [this one](http://observer.com/2016/11/new-dnc-emails-expose-more-dnc-media-clinton-campaign-collusion/). In addition, there were things such as the [Washington Post running 16 negative Bernie articles \(most of them false\) in 16 hours](https://fair.org/home/washington-post-ran-16-negative-stories-on-bernie-sanders-in-16-hours/). posted to submission: TIL Washington Redskins' owner Dan Snyder once cut down trees along the Potomac River so that he could see it from his house.

[23:55:20] Comment: dz1fprb by MonopolyMeal : MSRA is meant to assist a user with user things. Same with Skype, and same with any other remote assist tool that doesn't work well with UAC. As for reducing UAC... you're not disabling it sure, but you're changing the security posture of the operating system.  Here's a snippet from 
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc505883.aspx

Understanding the Secure Desktop

One method by which malicious applications might attempt to collect sensitive information from the user is by emulating a standard application or window. This is particularly true of the UAC elevation prompt. Users might be prompted for credentials by an unauthorized application that appears to be a standard Windows dialog box. The program collects user names and passwords and then might use this information to compromise security.

To prevent this problem, Windows Vista displays elevation prompts, using a secure desktop. The secure desktop automatically dims the desktop background and prevents all applications from launching any new prompts or windows until the user makes a decision related to the UAC elevation prompt. In this way, the user can be assured that the UAC prompt is coming from the Windows Vista operating system itself.

So, disabling secure desktop opens up the ability for some other program to steal your users' or even your own admin account credentials.

Is security annoying now? posted to submission: alternatives to SCCM remote control viewer tool

[23:55:48] Comment: dz1fpru by HinduTrumpian : Fair position, I guess we can agree to disagree.

Keep in mind that I am absolutely in favor of the free market. But the free market requires some restraints in order to perpetuate itself. Anti-trust laws are a case in point. Protecting employee rights, I would argue, is another. I don't think any employer should be forced to hire and pay an employee he doesn't need. But I also don't think my employer has the right to police my personal life. I, for example, am a scientist and spend most of my day behind a computer. If my boss told me he would fire me unless I come over to his house next weekend and wash his car, most people can see why he should not have the right to do this. I would argue that the same is true if an employee wants to go to a white supremacist rally in his spare time.

Obviously none of this shuld preclude anyone from firing an unproductive employee. posted to submission: What‚Äôs something you wish the Right was better at?

Personally, book-Fitzjames always seemed a bit undercooked (pun not intended). He's fine there, and I liked that he and Crozier ended up as friends as well, but both their relationship and Fitzjames' character are 100 times better in the series. Now I know why: the showrunners definitely used this biography to add some depth to the story.  posted to submission: Non-fiction books about the Franklin Expedition

[23:57:08] Comment: dz1fuat by strymol : As has been mentioned by others the ease at which you solve the structure of a protein vary greatly.

When you solve a structure in class you use a protein which is prone to crystallize and you even have some kind of known conditions to start from. That is very different from solving a protein structure of something which is not prone to crystallizing and where you are starting from scratch. It is very possible that some proteins are unable to be crystallized. But even for targets which can crystallize you need to remember that the chemical space you need to explore for finding the right conditions is practically infinite, so even if conditions exists but are few, you may never find them.

Some proteins are more prone to crystallize than others and I have worked on projects where I got crystals within the first week after preparing an appropriate sample. But preparing an appropriate sample for crystallography can also be hard. Some proteins are hard to purify and may be inherently stable. Another important consideration is that it need not only be a pure protein sample - You also need a conformationally pure sample. But all of this assumes that you have a protein which expresses well or can be found in high abundance in a natural source as protein crystallography require mgs of protein.

Often to overcome many of theses concerns people use single to few domain constructs of proteins and sometimes truncate floppy N- and C-terminals. But then you may lose some, if not all, of the interesting features of the protein, and introduce artefacts.

Two other important considerations that I did not mention is 1: The crystals need to diffract well. I've spend many a long night at synchotrons trying to collect data on hundreds of crappy crystals which did not diffract x-rays at all, or only to unusable resolution (even though they looked nice in the microscope). So you also need crystals which diffracts x-rays well. 2: You may have heard of the phase problem: When crystals diffract x-rays you need to collect both the amplitude of the diffracted wave as well as the relative phase of the wave compared to all the other waves. However you only measure the intensity of the diffracted beam which is proportional to the amplitude. You have to somehow get all the phases afterwards (even though they are much more important than the amplitude). You can do this in different ways, the easiest being just stealing the phases from a very similar protein which has already been solved, though that is often not available. I know people who have had good diffraction data for more than 3 years before they recovered the phases. (And yes that is extremely frustrating).

So to sum up: Solving structures is sometimes very hard posted to submission: How hard is it, really, to solve a structure?

[23:57:35] Comment: dz1fub0 by IHateHateHateHaters : I'm sympathetic to the idea that people shouldn't have to resort to police interaction for such exchanges, but many laws exist solely to address a specific problem that eventually reached a breaking point due to getting extremely out of hand (see: business regulations meant to plug exploitative holes in the system). If it can be demonstrated that there is an even loosely cohesive movement of young men who go out of their way to approach, gaslight and harass women, I can see countries, states or communities passing such laws or ordinances as a way of drawing a line in the sand and saying, "As a community/state/country we will not accept this behavior." After all the behavior in the first place is essentially a challenge to the existing social order - "What are you gonna do about it?"

Regardless of how you or I feel, though, government has a long and well-established history of skirting right up alongside the rights of the individual to try and address people who utilize loopholes in "freedom" to exploit or harm others in a way that leaves them no legal recourse. posted to submission: Incel on r/amiugly

[23:57:48] Comment: dz1fub9 by Urbanscuba : It's not renewable, but it's a potent and ample resource nonetheless that gain in efficiency as technology improves. 

Compare that to hydrocarbons which are far less concentrated, require massive logistics to transport, and produce greenhouse gases and it's no contest.

Nuclear is how you form the backbone of a society's electrical grid while it transitions to future tech like dispersed solar and superengineering projects for renewables. In 10 years of serious effort we could switch the majority of the U.S.'s grid to nuclear and massively cut both our pollution as well as make the U.S. 100% energy independent. In the long term we'd save both money and lives.

It won't happen, but it could. We've got enough fuel to power the entire world's projected energy growth for several hundred years, and that's not counting thorium/MSR reactors and even later potential generations. That's easily enough time to transition to full renewables. Newer reactors fail safer than ever too, and less often than ever. There's a reason all the currently operating reactors are pretty low profile, they like being safe and boring.

Even at current failure rates they still cause less death and injury than coal or NG, and importantly they don't produce greenhouse gases. It's not a question of if we've done damage to the environment, it's a question of how much have we done and is it reversible. The longer we wait to make major cuts the less becomes reversible.  posted to submission: TIL that the GPS service used globally is paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense, and costs upwards of a billion dollars annually.

Not at all.

Where AoS has high numbers is the percentage gain from L+SD to L+7. But the L+7 numbers themselves are still low, just not quite as low relative to other shows as in L+SD.

Take [the most recent L+7 numbers](http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/dvr-ratings/week-31-broadcast-live-7-ratings-april-23-29-2018/): AoS had a 150% gain from L+SD to L+7 in the demo and an 88% gain in viewers, but the L+7 ratings were still just 1.0 & 3.2 million. posted to submission: 'Agents of SHIELD' season 6 delayed, to air summer 2019

[23:59:01] Comment: dz1fucu by Cowboy_Dwayne : I don't know if it's wholly impossible, even a couple current guys could get about there if they play consistently into their very early 40's like Jerry did. A quick look at stats and you can see that outside of his rookie year Antonio Brown is averaging just over 1400 receiving yards a year. He's 30 this year and has 9910 yards so far so 12985 left and over 11 years that's 1180 yards a season he needs if he retires at the same age as Jerry. 

Brown doesn't have a serious injury history and shouldn't be counted out of making it a long career with increased player longevity and all. Odell and Julio can also have a shot but Brown just seems like the safer bet.  posted to submission: What are some records that will be broken soon? What are some that won't be broken soon?

[23:59:40] Comment: dz1fzmt by GeneticCleansing : > Because people accuse the victim of lying.

Guilty until proven innocent is not a good policy. You shouldn't be able to accuse me of raping you and have everyone believe you. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happens.

If anything, people are too believing. Accusing someone of rape can ruin their entire lives. Peoples' lives and reputations should not be ruined by an accusation of rape.

>  Because people say the victim wanted it. Because people say the victim shouldn't have worn that outfit/been in that neighborhood/had that drink/left her house unchaperoned after dark. 

No disagreement

> Because the rape was traumatic, and because the collection of evidence right after being raped was traumatizing.

I disagree with this logic. Evidence is a necessity when accusing someone of something as severe as rape. To rationalize *not* collecting evidence / reporting it, while still expecting the person who supposedly committed the crime to be punished, would be absurd. posted to submission: Why would anyone EVER feel ashamed to report being raped?

[23:59:41] Comment: dz1fzmv by ysmaydeki : Ten things is kind of a lot. I guess it was just getting used to the idea of haggling for me. The big one was bottled water. A 1.5L should be 10-12K. I had people try to charge me 30K.

Ben Thanh Market was my first stop in Vietnam. I ordered a bowl of Pho. Was charged 50K. Thought $2.50 wasn't bad. Some guy was like, "no, how about 10K?" I thought that guy was just being a dick. Later in my trip, I paid 10K for a bowl in a restaurant, although 20-35K seemed more common.

I didn't get a good idea for taxi rides. But I usually asked for price beforehand rather than have them run the meter. One trip I went 10 km for 100K. On the way back, a different cab driver wanted to charge 150K. We settled on 120K, which was probably more in line with what it should be (I think the meter would've been 130K).

I ordered a coffee at a cafe. Menu said 10K. When it came, she charged me 12K. I questioned it, but didn't feel like arguing over less than 10 cents. So I gave her 15K expecting change. She left and didn't come back. Kind of wish I would've made a scene, but not worth it. Getting coffee at a cafe that comes with tea while you wait for 40-60 cents was pretty great.

By the end of my trip, I even argued with a hostel to get half-price accommodation since I arrived very late at night. Paid 50K and it came with breakfast.

Basically, a lot of places would have prices listed and those were the prices I would set in my mind for places that didn't have prices listed. Most people were willing to haggle, even in convenience stores, but if I knew they were trying to rip me off, I would just go to a different store. posted to submission: Scammed on day 1 in Ho Chi Minh and feeling really shitty

[23:59:46] Comment: dz1fzn5 by CynosureRS : Bow makes a pretty big difference, especially for stacking big hits with veng on jad to 3-4 hit him. Chins also help a fair bit for stacks (say you stack 2 bats/blobs together and 1 hit them, you save 3 ticks killing them instead of piping each individually) and if things spawn on top of each other (in certain rotations on later waves you can have a blob spawn on top of a mager). Mostly it's just predicting the wave spawns though, and being stood within attack range of the highest level monster for that wave. That way you can be dps'ing it (since it has the most hp) whilst the bats/blobs come towards you and not lose time there. In a perfect run there should be no ticks that you spend not attacking something when you could be (though that is unrealistic, it's something to aim for).

The waves a cycle for positions of the highest level NPC, which you can get used to slowly over time. The EXTREMELY USEFUL spreadsheet I used for that was: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JbtL1AtGbkl88G0G8bWhtGFnK3OcNp4-3AmZBtaEOWU/edit?pageId=102435736585041161314#gid=0 - used that until the very end. posted to submission: Just got my first firecape is this PB any good?
