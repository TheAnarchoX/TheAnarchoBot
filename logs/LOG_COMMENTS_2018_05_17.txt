[11:14:05] Comment: dz4e3k9 by QWOP_Sparkle : Brilliant article.

The figures showing an increase in younger people identifying as trans, as opposed to gay or lesbian, concerns me slightly.

 For one, it is personal choice if a person feels comfortable with coming forward about being trans, however, if they feel their gender identity is being questioned simply because of the clothes they wear, the colours they like and the toys they chose to play with as children, then thats an issue. These things are just objects, and a person shouldn't feel like there is anything wrong with their gender based on what they like.

Secondly, the fact that women are coming forward identifying as trans in the beginning, then feeling comfortable with being a lesbian, is somewhat normal in just finding yourself and I don't think it should be seen as a major concern. My sexual orientation went straight > bisexual > lesbian. I don't see any issue with my feeling like I was bisexual first, but more so a stepping stone into becoming more comfortable and accepting with my sexuality. Everybody comes to terms with their own identity in their own way, with the growth of gender identity becoming a topic over recent years, it may simply become the norm that someone may transition with their gender *and* their sexuality and that they are given the right support in helping them feel comfortable with who they are.

The big concern is where the article mentions transphobia in terms of a person's choice in who they are physically attracted to. The fact that transwomen are throwing the term "transphobia" around because a lesbian is simply not physically attracted to them is dangerous to young lesbians, who may feel socially pressured into being in a relationship with them to avoid having that label. Sexuality and preferences isn't a choice, it is what it is, and the fact that they're being forced to go against their own feelings of attraction is wrong. I feel like we're starting to go backwards, where at one point men were given the right to women's bodies  (and some still feel they do), and now we're having a minority of transwomen feeling like they have the right to a lesbians body? It just doesn't sit well with me, it genuinely terrifies me if I were to ever meet a transwoman who hasn't transitioned and I feel like I have to fight for my right to say no. posted to submission: The silencing of the lesbians | Coffee House

I dont know of any municipality that has engaged in crony capitalism to promote one provider over the other unless you're referring to the "oligopoly" argument.

New providers to a market will depend on your area. Around me comcast had a stranglehold until recently when century link moved in but they still dont cover all areas. 

With government intervention and forcing providers to provide a certain service, even at a cost deficit, then you'll see less and less companies in certain areas and less money being spent on infrastructure, innovation etc. posted to submission: NN passes senate

And if you have the car on for AC or heat, you are using your gas, so it is less than $9/hr.

[17:29:44] Comment: dz4urzq by fiercebuellah : Ask for more. The worst they will say is ‘no’ or ‘not now’. If the answer is the worst, you have to decide if you’re OK with that. An employee worth anything will at least take away from it that you are smart enough to be thinking about your worth and value, and confident enough to ask for it. Sounds like you have enough of an argument to back up your reasoning with fact. I would not bring up that you consulted with the former employee on what they made.  posted to submission: I got a "promotion" at work. This didn't get a raise.

[17:29:57] Comment: dz4urzy by WikiTextBot : **Rod Blagojevich corruption charges**

In December 2008, then-Governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich and his Chief of Staff John Harris were charged with corruption by federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald. As a result, Blagojevich was impeached by the Illinois General Assembly and removed from office by the Illinois Senate in January 2009. The federal investigation continued after his removal from office and he was indicted on corruption charges in April 2009. The jury found him guilty of one charge of making false statements with a mistrial being declared on the other 23 counts due to a hung jury after 14 days of jury deliberation.

[17:30:01] Comment: dz4us02 by onefutui2e : Isn't their only way of denying through the Graia-like stratagem?

IMO, the lack of psykers in AdMech is noticeable, but not game breaking. Most if not all of out units have special rules (e.g., -1 toughness Vanguard, dealing mortal wounds on the charge with priests, etc.) along with our canticles, forge world stratagems, and general ability to sling ludicrous amounts of firepower downfield kind of balances it out, IMO. Having played my friend and his TSons, there were maybe a few times where I wished I had a denial in my pocket for his buffs but otherwise I never felt like him having psykers gave him an advantage over me.

Not to mention that a lot of psyker buffs only affect the faction units that psyker belongs to (e.g., Sanctic Discipline buffs can only target Grey Knights), so you're really taking them for offensive spells like Smite. Not bad for an army that outside of Mars can't really deal mortal wounds at range, but again, not terribly back breaking when you consider how much firepower we can put out.

IMO having a vanguard detachment with Greyfax and 1x3 Acolytes will give you the most economy at 109 points. 2 denies at +1 with 1 cast (Terrify or Dominate are pretty good). She can confer her leadership to your troops so you can run blobs of vanguard around her. Her acolytes effectively give her 3 extra wounds. And you'll still have 1891 points for your actual AdMech army.

Of course, this also means that if you play against an army with no psykers (Tau, Necrons, etc.) this detachment will sit around doing not a whole lot. But again, at 109 points it's not a big deal. posted to submission: Sisters of Silence detachment with Admech

HOW did God go about defining Good and Evil?

He could have if she was definitely still unconscious all the way from being choked out in sector 6, through carrying her to sector 22, through destroying the lab and still unconscious when he left her there. How long does one stay unconscious after a choke hold?

Mib was in the park approximately one week before the gala night. Charlotte finding him anchors his timeline to Theresa's timeline, which means she dies probably the night that he's tied up with Teddy and Angela. That next day he gets to escalante where he meets Dolores, and that's gala day. Bernard shoots himself, gets patched by Felix and confronts Ford and Dolores on gala night. 

So, I'm trying to see where Elsie is in connection to Bernard, because then Bernard connects me to Theresa to MIB to try and triangulate when bernard did his things. That's the only reason I mentioned Dolores, because I know where she is once she meets mib at the church.  posted to submission: Bernard/Elsie cave timeline

[17:32:31] Comment: dz4v059 by PartyAlias : Thank you everyone for your feedback. I guess i will make the following changes to first design:

1. Fuel consumption does seem a little excessive, i'll reduce engine boost from 1200 to 1000 each, leading to 5000 km/s speed. Should still be reasonable enough.
2. I really thought i can skip additional micromanagement but yeah, you guys are right. I'll make 2 variants of this, one command with 2 sensors (current antiship 250 ton sensor + additional anti-fighter sensor just in case) + flag bridge + moar armor - less tubes to compensate. Second variant with only small 50t active sensor for emergency. And i'll add second anti-fighter fire control to be able to target small ships to both of em.

I know turrets would be better than CIWS in groups, but i really cannot be bothered with additional beam R&D (i have no energy scientist at all) + additional fire controls R&D + in combat micromanagement of those turrets (i've had that enough in past games). I hope that CIWS + shields + okay initial puch should be enough to minimize return fire damage. Later on i might build additional variant for point defence... Maybe. 

So, i plan to use these ships in groups of 4, 1 command + 3 fighter variants. I think i'll build 8 or 12 of them tops. Their main goal will be to secure my forces while i explore/expand to other systems. 8 of these should be able to fight minor spoilers, and i really hope should do some real damage if i will discover some early non-player race homeworld (probably i'll need more than 8 for that). I plan that i will be working hard to expand my empire, terraform some worlds and get a stable supply of resources for a long time, will not be researching military techs untill i finish first expansion wave. So these ships will be used for a long time. posted to submission: Need some advice concerning early missile destroyer design

[17:34:21] Comment: dz4v06k by Jamessuperfun : > I quoted the police union to demonstrate that decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs doesn't eliminate or significantly reduce gang crime, which is what was being suggested is the case.

Nobody suggested it would eliminate it. How does the police union making a statement better demonstrate something than actual statistics on crime? Dutch ministers have even [refuted the claim](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/970519/news-netherlands-narco-state-drugs-corruption-ferdinand-grapperhaus-police-crime) which was part of the union's report calling for increased budgets (it has an obvious bias here). 

The data does suggest crime has been significantly reduced in places that legalised or decriminalised drugs. [The Netherlands is an abnormally safe country](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?locations=NL-GB-AU-CA-EU-NO-FR-SE-DE) and is [getting safer](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2017/41/further-drop-in-registered-crime-and-suspect-rates). I have linked to a number of [studies](http://ftp.iza.org/dp10522.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwioi6_x05jaAhVQa8AKHb9JBEc4ChAWMAd6BAgGEAE&usg=AOvVaw0l4L-OQLi0RruEJBWLLz_S) which suggest a causal relationship in other countries too. Drugs are consistently responsible for more deaths in countries with prohibition than without, [rates collapse](https://m.mic.com/articles/120403/14-years-after-decriminalizing-drugs-one-chart-shows-why-portugal-s-experiment-has-worked#.lIEBsnzIs) following decriminalisation. Even looking to your other examples of substances in the UK, the [vast majority of users obtain them legally](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2016/11/illicit-spirits-could-be-20-of-uk-market/) despite other barriers compared to an entirely criminal market. Crime is connected heavily to prohibition.

> you're trying to demonstrate something else and I haven't disagreed with you

I'm trying to demonstrate that crime reduces following legalisation (in different categories, obviously). How does a significant crime reduction following legalisation and lower crime in places with increased legal access to drugs not support the theory that the influence of criminal organisations will fall following the legalisation of drugs? Are you arguing that it reduces crime (including violent crime), but that this is not tied to gang crime? posted to submission: Met figures reveal 'deeply troubling' rise in serious crime in London

[17:34:44] Comment: dz4v06p by GarishManc : Israel was defending their border from Hamas, a group who actively encourage their citizens to get themselves wounded by Israeli forces to garner international sympathy. This was not a protest, the express intent of these demonstrations is to pass the barricade and cause harm to Israel and Israelis. If the Canadian first responder who was shot in the leg, is being entirely honest then it is a great shame that medical staff were harmed, but that is the risk they take. 

Israel is under constant criticism from the international community for daring to defend itself from a terrorist organisation, Hamas, and its underhanded tactics. No nation in the world is more unfairly treated by the UN. Do some research if you have a genuine interest.  posted to submission: Israel showed remarkable restraint today against Gazans
[17:34:47] Comment: dz4v06r by supamonkey77 : Many people on the other side fail to see the effects. By the time the order to go heavy handed on illegals(a surgical scalpel approach) comes down to the border patrol/ICE agents, it turns into a sledgehammer where all brown people/people with accents get smashed.

Same with the "Muslim orders". By the time it gets to the street level it turns into a sledgehammer too, affecting every brown person whether they are Muslim or not.

And then they act surprised about why so many legal immigrants and non muslims oppose those ideas and oppose them.

Aside from the human/fair treatment factor, it literally affects our legal, non Muslim day to day lives. posted to submission: ICE claimed a Dreamer was “gang-affiliated” and tried to deport him. A federal judge ruled that ICE was lying.

[17:35:32] Comment: dz4v078 by aThornForEveryRose : Same here, I'm 5'9" and *ideally* I like my doms to be bigger than me for those same reasons. Being physically overpowered is ridiculously hot, and I'm decently strong so it's not super easy. 

In addition to the physical aspects of it being less important irl than in fantasy, I also want to mention that sometimes people surprise you with their strength and ability to maneuver you. I've been with a couple guys that were pretty close in size to me and weren't especially beefy, yet were surprisingly strong and could toss me around like nothing. Other guys have been over 6' and yet had trouble even lifting me up. And one of the most aggressive doms I've played with was actually a lady who was a bit shorter than me, she manhandled me better than just about anyone. So even if your bf is about your size he still might have no problems giving you all the physical things you want.  posted to submission: Too tall for submission? (DMs welcome)
