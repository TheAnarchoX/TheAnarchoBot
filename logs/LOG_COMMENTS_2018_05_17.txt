>I really wish HTC would've kept that iconic design.

Half the industry basically copied it. Everything from the iPhone 6 to the OnePlus 3 design is an off-shoot of that original M7 design. Which HTC btw continued using up until HTC 10.

If you're not in a dedicated coffee shop, then you can offer to rering the sake with the correct price. As for the item not being in stock, mention that sometimes items don't get filled properly due to various situations, maybe the warehouse was out of the product or maybe it's in the store but hasn't been stocked yet. Offer to check the order or the back room and see if the item is in. posted to submission: Reddit, please suggest a good answer for this question.

[11:14:05] Comment: dz4e3ka by EarthPrimeArchivist : You're forgetting tho, that they did all of the pre-season 6 promos without Felicity and with a lot of Black Siren in an attempt to lure old viewers back. They did the same during the season, they hyped up Black Siren, and the olicity break up scene that turned out to be a hallucination, the kickass action scene in the season 1 outfit, and Tommy coming back - all done in an attempt to lure in viewers who've been boycotting or tuning out.

[11:14:05] Comment: dz4e3k9 by QWOP_Sparkle : Brilliant article.

The figures showing an increase in younger people identifying as trans, as opposed to gay or lesbian, concerns me slightly.

 For one, it is personal choice if a person feels comfortable with coming forward about being trans, however, if they feel their gender identity is being questioned simply because of the clothes they wear, the colours they like and the toys they chose to play with as children, then thats an issue. These things are just objects, and a person shouldn't feel like there is anything wrong with their gender based on what they like.

Secondly, the fact that women are coming forward identifying as trans in the beginning, then feeling comfortable with being a lesbian, is somewhat normal in just finding yourself and I don't think it should be seen as a major concern. My sexual orientation went straight > bisexual > lesbian. I don't see any issue with my feeling like I was bisexual first, but more so a stepping stone into becoming more comfortable and accepting with my sexuality. Everybody comes to terms with their own identity in their own way, with the growth of gender identity becoming a topic over recent years, it may simply become the norm that someone may transition with their gender *and* their sexuality and that they are given the right support in helping them feel comfortable with who they are.

The big concern is where the article mentions transphobia in terms of a person's choice in who they are physically attracted to. The fact that transwomen are throwing the term "transphobia" around because a lesbian is simply not physically attracted to them is dangerous to young lesbians, who may feel socially pressured into being in a relationship with them to avoid having that label. Sexuality and preferences isn't a choice, it is what it is, and the fact that they're being forced to go against their own feelings of attraction is wrong. I feel like we're starting to go backwards, where at one point men were given the right to women's bodies  (and some still feel they do), and now we're having a minority of transwomen feeling like they have the right to a lesbians body? It just doesn't sit well with me, it genuinely terrifies me if I were to ever meet a transwoman who hasn't transitioned and I feel like I have to fight for my right to say no. posted to submission: The silencing of the lesbians | Coffee House

[11:14:15] Comment: dz4e3ki by R_Davidson : Chess. Can get a cheap set, works same as expensive (expensive is jsut nicer) and you will have a game that you could learn how to play in a day yet takes an entire lifetime to master. Nothing like OTB play (over the board). I grew up playing chess and love it, especially drunk chess. I haven't played in years cause it's too hard to find people where I live that play and playing online on a screen just isn't the same.


I've played online matches before where I'd set up a real board and play my opponent and move the pieces on the board with the online game, it's just not the same as actually having the other human player sitting across from you.  posted to submission: What board game is worth buying?
