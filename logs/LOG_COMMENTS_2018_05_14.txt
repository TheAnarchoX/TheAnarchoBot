So I wouldn't be surprised if someone who stands to get rich off of this assistance given to ZTE, called trump up and did a bit of ass kissing and promise making in order to make this happen.

[20:05:00] Comment: dyyz25v by DagronJoe : Define "all". I probably wouldn't suggest you to fill yourself up and then plug so it stays in.

It's certainly possible for bacteria to build up in the lube over time. That stated, there's not much "food" for the bacteria. Ingredients are water, polyethylene oxide \(aka Polyethylene Glycol used in laxatives, non\-toxic antifreeze, skin creams, toothpaste, sweetener for things like Mio... probably doesn't hurt most bacteria but shouldn't cause growth in most either\) to make slippery and thick, Titanium Dioxide \(used in suntan lotion and paint\) to make it white, Potassium Sorbate \(aka sorbic acid\) is a preservative and inhibits molds and yeasts, and citric acid is used to pH balance as acidity is one of the bodies natural defenses and it is uses in natural disinfectants.

So, generally, it has several things that inhibit mold, yeast, and bacteria. There's little that would feed bacteria, but something could obviously be introduced to the bottle from the air or "backwashing". In general, it should be safer than most things. There's always a risk, but it should be pretty small, unless your allergic to Polyethylene Glycol. I'd spend more time being concerned whether you properly washed your toys first.

PS: Other products people use as lubes may contain sugar... that's a bigger concern. posted to submission: Lube and infections?
[20:05:01] Comment: dyyz25w by s888marks : Hm, I never thought of using an `enum`. I wouldn't recommend it, though, for a few reasons.

One, declaring an enum with no constants (instances) is kind of a strange thing to do. The syntax also requires a semicolon to separate the (nonexistent) constants from the body of the enum declaration:

    enum Utility {
        ;
        static void method() { System.out.println("Utility.method() called"); }
    }

Second, enums have a few static methods that can "leak" into the namespace of the utility method. One is inherited from the Enum superclass, and the others are synthesized by the compiler. You can see them in IDE auto-completion, which would probably be confusing. Here are some examples of legal calls:

    Utility.valueOf(Thread.State.class, "NEW"); // returns Thread.State.NEW
    Utility.valueOf(""); // throws IAE
    Utility.values(); // returns empty array

Third, the synthesized methods require more tests to be written in order to achieve code coverage requirements. (Oh, that's a really **bad** reason.)

I think a final class with a private do-nothing constructor is still the best. I suppose one could have it throw an exception, but that seems overkill to me. (The JDK is inconsistent on this point. `java.util.Collections` has an empty private constructor, but the constructor of `java.util.Objects` throws AssertionError.) posted to submission: How to write horrible Java - some practical advice

[20:06:26] Comment: dyyz9d6 by hechang27 : > "Jewish" lands stolen 
Before the Ottoman empire it was Mamluk Sultanate, before the Mamluks was the various Caliphates and Crusaders, and before that was Romans and Byzantines, and before that was Assyrians and Babylonians. Last independent Jewish "nation" in Palestine is at least 2000 years ago. It puzzles beyond me why westerners somehow see a Jewish nation as more legitimate. Pragmatically I still would like Palestinians to renounce their violent approach as Irish and South Africans did because they won't achieve anything militarily, but no matter what, it is always Israeli state that stole Palestinian (Jewish and Arab alike) land. posted to submission: Israeli forces kill ten in Gaza protests as anger mounts over U.S. Embassy
[20:06:30] Comment: dyyz9dd by -Champloo- : It's not results based at all if you're predicting the games though.

Game 1 I can't give them too much crap for, as it was their first game and they didn't see the soraka pick coming. However, picking Jhin vs Karma+Olaf is asking for trouble. Add Ryze to that and you're in even more trouble, as the Ryze can't deal with *any* of the champions that KZ picked.

Game 2, picking Ryze *into Cassio* is simply arrogant in my opinion. That is a match up the cassio has historically won and been able to roam, in addition to providing more team fight damage and dps. We also absolutely hate Impact on carries- TL proved during the split that he needed to be on a tank or they would struggle overall... So they put him on a carry again, well fucking done coaching staff. I won't blame them for not seeing Zac coming, but Zac is one of the best champions in the game at pressuring Jhin, combine that with an Ezreal, Alistar and Cassio and the Jhin's life is very difficult outside of playing ultra safe. Jhin is able to put out a lot of damage in that scenario, but not in a timely or opportune manner which can often lead to high damage for Jhin despite losing the fight.

Game 3 I had no problems with their draft really, Joey just got hit by every. Single. Binding. And was constantly low HP, resulting in what was basically a 1v2 lane for DL, and a massive pressure sinkhole that made map movement and vision control extremely difficult. This resulted in Pob getting caught a ton and looking kinda boosted, but if you're drafting a comp in which you want to split push... You can't afford to get booty blasted in one of the lanes.

Game 4 the draft was okay....... However, they made a huge mistake leaving Yasuo up after the second ban wave. Literally, when that pick was made I called that the game was over- Yasuo had been so good for FNC in scrims that TL started playing it and broke it out on stage. Pob proceeded to get absolutely fucking shit on by it, and TL had absolutely no answer for it *much like they apparently had no answer for it in scrims*. Why you ban two supports over Yasuo in that situation is just beyond me, especially when they took Trundle early... The exact same shit TL picked it for. 

Game 5 the draft was really good in my opinion. The "power" pick you conceded was xayah/rakan, but that doesn't seem to be that strong thus far in the tournament, and you got more/cait into it which is quite good. Vlad into Zoe is great. Impact on a tank, and not being overly predictable with orn(rng picked Orn but I can't remember if TL took Vlad first and left that option open before them to take or not). Skarner obviously a strong pick.

Game 6 honestly KZ just crapped on them in draft phase by exploiting TL's known tendencies. TL has super priority on Trundle? Pick no tanks and a high wave clear mid to make him useless. Impact can only pick tanks? Play Camille and force him on Orn. As long as Pob didn't have a pocket pick to crush mid lane, that was GG(and in hindsight, Malz would have been a good pick here for Pob, but they wanted something to deal with Kench+taliyah map movement)

Game 7 Evos fucked up draft pretty hard imo. Kaisa into Kog, Khazix in general. TL did well with the Shen pick for Kog, especially after the Khazix pick. Rest of the draft was just kinda standard for both teams.

Game 8 HOLY SHIT THEY BANNED YASUO VS THE TEAM THAT CRUSHED THEM WITH IT IN SCRIMS. WHAT IS THIS NEXT LEVEL LOGIC? With that out of the way.... Took away the Olaf, and Trundle was already banned. This opens up the Jhin pick substantially, as picking Zac into Olaf is asking for trouble early, so they got forced onto Graves. You now don't have to worry about anton of dive as Jhin, regardless of the mid and top picks. They take sion and Karma which is solid, but Cho into Sion is a skill based match up and Malz is a perfect pick as a tank shredder with CC and strong wave clear.

None of this analysis required the games to actually play out, but advantages **are created* in pick/ban as much as some analysts don't want to admit it. It seems to me like analysts are coddling their peers(other coaches and analysts) and deflecting *all* the blame to the players. That's incredible to me. Players can always play better, that goes without saying. But in professional sports, coaches are held accountable and in league(or at least weatern league), they absolutely are not. You can tell me players have influence in pick ban and I get that, but at some point the "buck stops here" has to become an actual thing in league. If you follow American football at all, Jason Garret has been given a pass by management time and time again and the Coeboys suffer for it- the Cowboys take an old school approach to football, which is an eloquent way of saying they don't actually coach for shit. They line up and tell their players to execute every play. That's great when it works, but it's overly stubborn and when your team can't just out talent other teams, you can't do anything (eg Cowboys vs Broncos 2017, Cowboys vs Eagles 2017) and you look like an embarrassment. Meanwhile, The best coaches in the league find a way to give their team advantages even if they aren't all one of the best players in the league. They create matchups and draw up plays that favor their players and put them in a position to win. It's the same shit in league. You can draft Ryze/jayce and tell TSM to just go execute and win the game, or you can realize that Hauntzer can't manipulate waves well enough on Jayce to create a significant advantage and draft something he *can* do. You can realize Ryze was the worst mid laner in the entire tournament and not pick it, or you can tell Bjerg to play it anyway because it worked that one time when SKT did it, ignoring the fact that it was literally the best player in the world on the pick and their top laner was able to open up to for Ryze to actually work.

TL;DR stop giving teams a pass for poor pick ban phases. It should be the easiest facet of the game to *not be out at a disadvantage*. If you consistently fuck that up, you need to be fired, or your structure for P/B has to change. posted to submission: Team Liquid vs Fnatic / Rift Rivals Round Robin 2 Post Match Discussion

I'm guessing.... PVM-14L5, maybe? posted to submission: Ready to play some Sonic 3 on my PVM tonight. :)

[20:07:42] Comment: dyyz9ek by bethrevis : It *is* a polarizing book. 

For me, however, I love it--so much so that in *A World Without You*, I named my main character's sister Phoebe after Holden Caulfield's sister. I think it's because I read that book at a specific time in my life, a time where it meant a lot to me. I actually think that book speaks less to a generation, and more to an age. Some books encapsulate a specific generation of people (off the top of my head, I would say Adam Sandler movies, for example, really struck a chord with a specific demographic, and those films haven't aged as well since then), whereas others tend to grab a people--despite what generation they're born into--when they read a book at a certain time in their life, such as *The Catcher in the Rye*. posted to submission: I am Beth Revis, NYT bestselling author of young adult sci fi, including Across the Universe and Star Wars: Rebel Rising, AMA

[20:08:06] Comment: dyyz9f9 by Slothentic : Point 1. Two spirit doesn't apply to the whole world, only native Americal cultures. OP appears to have been referring to European cultures before Christianity, and probably those other than Greek and Roman cultures as well. I suggest doing some reading on ancient European cultures before infering that all those societies were very homophobic and classed gay men as a third gender, based on how native American culture worked.

Point 2. Although the ancient world had some pretty wierd beliefs about health, those second two links are extremely dodgey. I picked two of the more radical claims, namely the dog poo one and cannibalism in the renaisance and googled them. I can find no other sites claiming these things, nor any evidence that may point towards it. Sure I only spent 5 minutes searching but that sort of thing is likely to pop up quickly.

In summary, I'm not saying you're wrong because I don't agree and can't change what I think, I'm saying it because you haven't checked your sources, or checked that the facts you present prove your point and are relevant \(ie two spirit\). I wouldn't normally go tearing this sort of thing apart but for once I have the emootional energy to. So, if you find evidence that is both reliable \(as in you can show its not made up, which for some things in the third link I can't\) and that proves your point that this was the case for the societies op is referencing \(European\) I will happily look through and change my view accordingly.  posted to submission: A Third Gender has been recognized by societies and religions for centuries.

Cool side is probably around 74°. I would say an average temp of 80 sounds pretty good for them. They definitely don't need it super hot, 80's are good.

The tank I keep mine in sounds about the same 30 inches tall, then 4x2. I would post a pic but I'm on the app and I can't figure out how to do that in a comment. Only problem with my set up is it makes clean up poop hard since the tank is so tall. Getting them out is a pain also since there are so many branches to grab on to. One of my favorite species ever tho. Well with the extra husbandry requirements if you can handle it.

May I ask where you are getting them from? Most of the ones you see are imported and come in in bad shape. A few people breen them tho. I had a cb baby but it died.

Having someone work off a debt is not slavery.  One person should not feel ownership of another simply because the person owes them some sort of payment.

[20:09:30] Comment: dyyzfvs by EllieSpacePrincess : Problem with sex in not uncommon so don't think that this is weird or just happening to you. To me the idea behind being poly is that happiness is your own responsibility, yes our primary is there to support us but they're not responsible for meeting all your needs. This idea helps to take the 'perceived' strain off the relationship. You said that you have been feeling down for a while and have many good reasons why. I think it is important for you to rediscover your self, remind yourself what makes you happy and go out into the world and have some fun experiences, like a course or social group for one of your hobbies. The point I'm trying to make is that if you are happier as a person then this will make it easier for positive interactions between you (eventually leading to sex). I don't think sex is about wearing something sexy it's your body language as a whole. If you are stood on your own mountain of happiness then sexy stuff is more likely to happen because you will be filled with your own excitement. My primary has recently got back into photography and it's helpped her so much, the way her face lights up when she talks about it just makes her look ridiculously sexy, she gets that glint in her eye and is filled with passion. Generally this is an attractive quality. If someone is passionate about something it's wonderful hearing them speak about it and enjoyable being around them.

When people talk about the new relationship excitement, yes this is about newness but it is also about the wonder and excitement from that person. What I'm saying is that if your a person who is excited about their life then he can get a similar vibe for being around you. 

Kink is another part worth exploring, helps to keep sex new and vibrant with endless possibilities.


Alternative 
When one person in a relationship has issues with their life the other person can be their to pick them up constantly and be their rock. But the person being the rock can not really get support from the person they are supporting. So it makes sense for that person to find support and excitement from another source. If your partner is constantly depressed then it makes sense to avoid that person. Like if you have a good feeling, you will end up losing that if you engage with the relationship problems of the depressed partner. I'm not saying you should pretend to be happy, only that it makes sense to want to spend time with people where he can be care free and happy. Yes all problems need to be discussed and sorted out but after that time should be made for happiness.

When was the last time you went out on a date? Try going out to dinner after work (eat early).

Take the pressure off sex - do you only touch each other to have sex? this can cause issues by it's self. So maybe start from the basics. Touch him and turn him on without any intention of sex or cumming.

If you need a golden bullet look up and learn the lingham massage, it will blow his mind. 

It's hard to give advice without knowing the full story but I really hope this help. If you love each other then good communication can solve everything, but it sometimes take a long time to discover the real issue behind the problem, if there is one.

Peace and Love and the best of Luck x

As there is less melanin in the irises of light colored eyes, they let in more light (and more UV light) than darker eyes. This means that people with light colored eyes will squint more in bright light and reach for sunglasses sooner than others.

These are all questions I'm passionate about, so, rant incoming


>Do you ever find yourself surprised by where a story winds up: becoming fantastical when you don't intend it to go that way at first, or becoming literary when you initially intended it to be light-hearted?


Yes! I am surprised all the time. It's so fun when that happens. Like stumbling upon something during spring cleaning. "Oh! What's this? Soul crushing grief? I'd forgotten I left that here!" That's a sign that a character is working, I think. A *lot* of those surprises are character driven, and then affect other aspects as well. Grief pops up from behind the couch pretty frequently, to the point where I'm starting to expect it when I walk through the door, and now I'm craning my head to see who else might be hiding. 

The big scary question imo, though, is does making your dragon a victim of domestic violence (for example) make your fantasy story now a literary story? What even *is* literary? That's the whole issue I have--everybody wants to put stories in boxes, but nobody can agree what the masking tape labels mean. 

What does it mean to you?

> Do you think strictly separating these genres is more of a prison, or an opportunity?

I think whenever you're drawing lines in the sand, you're doing yourself as a creator a disservice...if you abide by them. It's fine to have genres. It's not fine to bow down and obey them. 

All I know is, I get excited about writing when I see an interesting way to find some middle ground, or break genre rules in fun ways. My favorite authors write stories about girls who are raised by wolves, or about the trapped ghost of Lincoln's dead son. These are fantasy stories. But they've found a way to resonate on a deeper level too. Little wolf girl is just like the rest of us, struggling to adapt. Or Lincoln's boy must deal with his own father's grief. Real life issues (some might say "literary") taking place in a fresh fantasy setting. *That's* what gets my heart pumpin'. 

> does the expectation that literature and genre fiction are separate kinds of writing help or hinder your own process?

Establishing the two categories hindered me. For the longest time, it was hard not to compare the two to eachother & view one as better. In school, I would try to write "literary", which at the time meant: "Put your tryhard pants on and begin vomiting pure gold." It didn't go well. It's fed into a perfectionist mentality that I still struggle with today. Like, I don't think I've even posted a WP response that I haven't gone back and edited. I can't help myself. 

Now I try not to think about it. I've changed my goal from: "write a literary masterpiece" to "just write something that makes you feel connected to others, man". 

I've found it's way more fun that way.

Nobody is entitled to anything.  Laborers get what they can negotiate with management.  That's how voluntary transactions work.  Your labor is worth exactly what people are willing to pay.  If management is forced to relent on wages or benefits due to collective bargaining, that's part of the free market process!

Once you're good with the fit and the style lines you can cut your muslin along the drawn lines and they will be your pattern pieces. Remember notches, seam allowance and mind the bias.

[20:15:20] Comment: dyyztol by phnt0m : ^ This
I don't care about nes games, it's something "more" but for me the most important thing is just playing Splatoon 2 and futur other multiplayer games (Mario Tennis, Smash etc.) like on PC : everybody is at same level (no advantage if you host the game, same server for everyone on a game), if you have a bad connection or whatever, it's only your problem. No instability, better performance and a real advantage to pay 19,99 !

The "Online" thing is not really online-related, we have a P2P multiplayer game since the beginning, why should we pay for this now ?
Nes games is not really related to online. It's okay for Save in cloud, but 19,99 for this... 

Really sad about all that thing, because I really like my switch and his games. For me is like you throw a lot of potential in trash can for nothing, server for multiplayer games is the basis if you ask to pay ! posted to submission: As a Nintendo fan, what have you been the most upset with Nintendo about?

[20:15:44] Comment: dyyztox by SpaceFabric : So it seems like I should continue cycling the same amount that I do, and just slowly build up my mileage to increase the resilience of my musculoskeletal system and capillarisation of muscles specific to running.

A big worry I had was that if I just focused on running and didn’t do any cycling, I’d go from 10 hours of cycling + 4 hours of running per week, to just 4+ hours of running a week, and I’m wondering if I would actually see a decline in running fitness then. This is mainly a worry right now because my bike has lots of mechanical issues, which caused a crash earlier this week, and I don’t really want to ride it hard until I get it fixed. posted to submission: Should I worry about base building for running when I have a cycling background?

Can't really go wrong with anything in the top 50. If you're busy, [A Silent Voice](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28851/Koe_no_Katachi) is a solid place to start. If you got time for a show, [Your Lie in April](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso?q=your%20lie%20in%20april) is a masterpiece of a followup that I can't not recommend to everyone that has the slightest interest in Anime.

I think the most important thing to remember is that Anime is a medium. Like books, there is a genre of Anime for everything under the sun. I'd encourage you to not limit yourself . For every emotional sonnet \([Your Lie in April](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso?q=your%20lie%20in%20april)\) there's a fun pick\-me\-up \([7 Deadly Sins](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23755/Nanatsu_no_Taizai)\). For every SciFi thriller \([Code Geass](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch)\), there's a Fantasy masterpiece \([Re: Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)\). For every casual account of day to day shenans \([K\-On](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On)\), there's a wild adventure \([Gurren Lagann](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann?q=gurren%20lagann)\).

Whether I die by my own hand at an early age or from a debilitating disease at old age it makes no difference. I promise you I'll be lucky if I get to 35 or 30 as I don't see the point in continuing this struggle of existence humans desperately crave for another 40-60 years. Plus what options are there for people such as me in an ever increasing globalized techno competitive future where at best I'll only have a fulfilling career, 401k, a wife and kids etc. and there's no guarantees that any of that will happen. Like seriously is that really the epitome of human existence? And I didn't even include the loneliness, despair, heartache, depression, anxiety, overwhelming feeling of dread, diseases, death of others and myself etc etc. that I will sooner or later experience unless I kill myself.

[20:17:36] Comment: dyz010a by Breviary_Buddy : +JMJ

After bringing my wife and daughter safely and healthily through pregnancy, the Holy Ghost came to live in my daughter's soul at her Baptism!

My wife is growing closer to God - I believe the Holy Ghost is guiding her to Christ and helping me to be a better example to her. I can't be sure, but I have a feeling next Easter will be when my wife is received the sacraments and enters the Church. Prayers please!

He has (God willing) conquered some sins that I thought after over a decade would never be conquered in my life. In all humility, I think by the grace of the Spirit I am the best person I've ever been right now, and I hope to keep getting better. He is helping me recognize other vices and helping me fight them.

He gave me Wisdom when I prayed for it (and sometimes even when I didn't) and helped me finally get through graduate school, and my final project was related to the Catholic faith, so I feel that it was/is/could be an opportunity at evangelism.

My family is on the verge of a number of other big decisions and changes, and I can see the Holy Ghost guiding us in those, too. In the moments when I feel like I can't see God, I look to the recent times when He has guided us right and am filled with trust and hope.

[20:18:01] Comment: dyz010y by the_pitizen : Who says the opposite and what metric are they using? Look you can even see how award ceremonies have over representation of black actors/winners: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/03/blacks_overrepresented_in_oscar_wins_since_2000.html        
           
And are you forgetting that a very large number of black actors star in movies made by black directors? Is it fair to say that it's not ok for blacks to generally depicted in a "ghettoized way" when they are often doing it to themselves?           
           
The problem is that your idealized "perfect representation" of minorities will never come to pass because it has no definitive goals or standards to be achieved and simply does not reflect reality. It does not account for the fact that poverty rates among blacks are much higher than many other racial groups in America. If it did, you would concede that at least 25% of all blacks depicted in the media would be impoverished  or even "ghettoized". You would have to concede that depictions of "ghettoized" blacks are popular and appealing to certain non-trivial elements of black culture and therefore the depiction of said ghettoized blacks is really a function of supply and demand.

[20:18:30] Comment: dyz011i by Valtiel164 : Try Nocturne or Rengar if you have having issues reaching the ADC Those champs are exceptionally well at reach the backline because of their ultis. As far as getting invaded early its all about the match up and vision. there are 2 options that you have:

A) Pick a good dueler that has a healthy clear (WW, Graves, Jax etc.)

or

B) Pay attention to see who comes in late to the lane on the enemy side so that you know where they started. Ward the entrance to the opposite buff right before you start it so that you know if they are coming or not ping the living crap of the enemy and wait for your team to come in unless you can out-duel him. 

*Bonus* Change your route completely to throw the enemy off such as start opposite buffs, go from buff to buff, first buff to gank (certain champs only) etc.

I mainly play Rammus and honestly is very hard to do the first clear because he is very slow and can get easily invaded and killed. posted to submission: Jungler looking to make the climb to Plat this season

I made categories and I just include any product I've tried at least a few times, and designate whether it was a sample, a mini/travel size product, or if I use(d) the full size. I spent longer than I should have to figure out how to set up a formula to calculate price per oz, but that has been super interesting to see, and will be very informative when I'm looking to (re)purchase products.


Note: CF = cruelty free, V = vegan, FF = fragrance free. Prices are based on full size products. This is just a screenshot but I made categories for cleansers, toners, exfoliants, spot treatments, eye creams, serums/treatments, oils, moisturizers, masks/peels, sunscreen, sprays, and lip balms/treatments.

[20:21:30] Comment: dyz0687 by Mezzos : McLaren weren't credited with any constructor's points at Hungary due to the Alonso-Hamilton incident they had in qualifying (though the drivers were still able to score points for the driver's championship).

> McLaren were not credited with the 15 constructors' points they earned, after Fernando Alonso was ruled to have held up Lewis Hamilton in qualifying.

> [...]

> The controversy in Hungary occurred towards the end of the final 15-minute qualifying period on Saturday when Alonso was held in his pit box for an additional 20 seconds by the team after taking on new tyres.

>The reigning world champion then remained stationary for a further 10 seconds, despite the lollipop lifting allowing him to exit.

>Hamilton was left queueing behind Alonso and was ultimately denied the opportunity of a final lap as the Spaniard went on to claim pole.

>The incident was later investigated by race stewards and, following a lengthy meeting, the explanations of McLaren and Alonso were rejected.

>The stewards deemed Hamilton had been "unnecessarily impeded" and so demoted Alonso from pole to sixth on the grid, while stating McLaren would not receive any constructors' points from the race.

[20:22:51] Comment: dyz0dic by Kiristo : Yea, I don't blame you not spending money on advertising.  Would have to be out of pocket.  I think the fact that it's now funded, it can naturally gain attention over time.  Wolcen did the same thing.  Their KS goal was pretty low, and they made it, but most people hadn't heard of it even a year after that.  I think the video Rhykker made gave them a ton of attention.  Same is likely to happen for Last Epoch.  Eventually, people will see it and want in.  Just hard to get the word out at the moment til someone who lots of people watch shows it off.  Most of the people I saw talking about Last Epoch are PoE streamers, and while that'll get the PoE crowd's attention, there are plenty of people who like ARPGs who don't like/play PoE.  

I'm still kind of shocked and impressed with how far you guys have come in a year or so.  I first heard about Last Epoch like a year ago just from posting on the PoE subreddit when moxjet was messaging folks looking for other ARPG fans for ideas/feedback.  That little project has turned into a pretty solid looking game in a short time, you guys have done a great job.  I like that, much like Wolcen, you're taking a lot of good ideas from existing games and some of your own ideas to create a better ARPG.  I think much like myself, when you're playing PoE or other ARPGs, you think this is great, but it could still be better.  Nice to see someone do something about it.  I think PoE's success has also shown this genre is far from dead and I hope at some point you're able to pump out content as consistently as they do.

[20:23:00] Comment: dyz0dil by Shadowdrake082 : First of all, WotW is a huge jump from WotD so it is natural to feel helpless.
 
Now some advice, to help deal more damage, it will come down primarily to build, weapons, and support jutsu buffs/debuffs.
 
* 1) Your weapon's + levels matter a lot. If you haven't been soul matching the + levels up, then you are far behind. WotW caps out at 250 (+30), starting out you should be at around 200 (+18). Once you get it to the +23 area things will start to feel a little normal.
 
* 2) Your weapon's rolls matter a lot, maybe more than the + levels. You need the trifecta rolls: Change to attack (highest stat) A-/A+, familiarity damage bonus A-/A+, and close combat damage 15%/20%. This leaves about 2-3 rolls for you to further customize your weapon as generally there is an innate unrollable stat and set bonus on all weapons. Most people would do Weaken armor (torso) for a chance to debuff armor, status ailment (element) to help apply an element faster, or weaken weapon to give yourself more survivability. You could also do a Close Combat attack (status ailment) roll to do more damage when you apply a status ailment.
 
* 3) Stat points. I'm sure you know, but every weapon has 3 stats that increase its overall attack power. At around level 350 you should be close to if not already have 99 in those 3 stats for your weapon. I wouldn't rush into doing all three unless you have a good reason to. Don't level Body because you want hp as that won't really matter at all if you use light and most medium armors.
 
* 4) Ninjutsu and Onmyo support. Hands down this will get you through your tough times because of the status ailments they can do as well as the buffs. For instance, you can skip most levels to get to a later region for grinding by using suppa and catwalking scrolls. You can poison enemies for slow damage and paired with change to attack (enemy poisoned) you do more damage. Onmyo magic is also extremely effective. You have the instant debuff casts to weaken enemies attack, speed, defense, and ki regeneration. You then get elements which when applied provide their own debuffs as well that stack with a similar debuff talisman. If you didn't know, apply any two elemental debuffs at the same time on a yokai and it is neutered by the discord effect to have 0 ki and take extra damage. While at it you have the buff spells to increase your attack, defense, and many more. 
 
* 5) Your build matters. Your armor and weapon set provides blanket bonuses like damage reduction and close combat damage, but the extra effects make individual play styles stand out. For instance, tatenashi is a very tank/survival oriented build as it helps to heavily reduce damage from firearms, elements, and overall. Red demon armor increases the damage you do when they are set on fire. You need to wear armor sets that complement how you play, their bonuses help to add up to everything else when you play according to the bonuses they give.
 
Usually to get a good weapon, you have to make it. Grind for the smithing text if you need one. Craft the divine version and use umbracite to get the necessary rolls. Alternately a player revenant may use that weapon if it is part of a popular set, in which case use what you found but you could still need to reroll its effects. Then do marobashi or a similar easy late game mission to get a stockpile of weapon's that have a high + level. Then soul match your weapon's + levels. Swap to the weapon when the + level is about the same level as the drops or current filler weapon and you will start to see it do more damage than you thought it would do as you continue to level it up. posted to submission: Hit a wall

[20:27:03] Comment: dyz0ns8 by Balck_RS : Welcome back! The game can totally be overwhelming now so clans are good if you feel like being a social person.

Training combat/slayer to get some money to train up buyable skills always seems to be suggested. Finishing the Elf quest series is also another suggestion.

Personally I focused more on tackling the quests since they’re something more tangible to work towards. Plus they unlock a bunch of solid content for skilling like Priffdinias and Seren spells which really help to accelerate towards the end game.

[20:28:52] Comment: dyz0nuk by asskikmrc : Maybe I am looking at it from a different perspective. In my example you knew which chests would have specific levels of specific items. For instance chest “a” at location East 42nd Street would always be a purple gun and chest “b” would always be blue equipment. It made the entire process feel scripted and left large portions of the map useless.   If Fortnite were to implement that it would drive people to the same areas. RE: OP’s comment about gold scar locations. 

Now without any rng you would still just avoid the areas that you know no loot chest would be present. For example if the Junk is guaranteed to have at least one chest per house and Haunted isn’t then why would anyone ever go to Haunted as opposed to Junk and skipping Haunted all together. 

I think you’re on to something I could more likely align to but it would have to be a very fine line. When you (not you but OP) made mention of specific variants guaranteed to be a specific locations then you will run into issues that I have experienced due to this exact thing.

[20:29:08] Comment: dyz0svg by TrumpsAltAccount : "I can't buy my house"

Sure, zoning and heavy regulations on new building, especially in cities, leading to housing shortages and high rental prices is a real bitch. I'd argue that we should get rid of most of those rules, but somehow I doubt you'd agree.

"Wealth inequality"

Who cares how much your neighbor is making if you're still better off? 

"Statistics give you a warped view of the situation"

I'm not saying there aren't still problems, I'm saying that those problems are getting better as a result of more freedom and more capitalism around the world. No, they won't all be solved tomorrow, but that doesn't mean we should chase the same ideologies that have ready gotten millions killed and cause economic disaster from which countries are still recovering. posted to submission: American Failure: the top 0.1% owns as many assets as the bottom 90%.

So many of us have never been truly on our own: we left our parents' house and go from relationship to relationship without know who we really are.

[20:30:22] Comment: dyz0swn by derpdurdle : I think it was just intuition. At one point in time, some early primate had to manage and oversee the number of people in each tribe, making sure they had the correct number of people. Counting was addition, and making way for the absence of those hunting was subtraction. Later on, when calculating larger units, one might have used multiplication \(eg: counting infantrymen\).  Also, division must have occurred from the early onset of life, as dividing shares of a kill would be necessary. Sooner or later, fractions would  be invented as numerical representations of dividing \(decimals would come later, after the basis of the numerical system on 10.\) Everything from there was most likely pure intuition, and have their own origin stories. posted to submission: How did people discover math from nothing?

[20:30:49] Comment: dyz0swy by bout_357 : Most "mass shootings" as defined by the FBI [are actually domestic violence incidents](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/07/562387350/in-texas-and-beyond-mass-shootings-have-roots-in-domestic-violence).  Basically crazy husbands and boyfriends killing their wives/girlfriends and families with handguns.

[There are fewer mass shootings in schools today than there were during the AWB](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593831564/the-disconnect-between-perceived-danger-in-u-s-schools-and-reality), despite record numbers of AWs introduced into circulation since the expiration of the AWB.

[AW ban's don't work as made evident by the efficacy of the Clinton-era AWB](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/204431.pdf).  It had little to no impact on overall gun deaths.  Murders involving semi-automatic rifles started out within a margin of error, and after the 10 year period of the AWB, they stayed within a margin of error.

> A 2004 critical review of firearms research by a National Research Council committee said that an academic study of the assault weapon ban "did not reveal any clear impacts on gun violence outcomes." The committee noted that the study's authors said the guns were relatively rarely used criminally before the ban and that its maximum potential effect on gun violence outcomes would be very small. posted to submission: Overwhelming objection to Oregon assault weapon ban ballot title

 I am assuming this is the first time he penetrated her while asleep and that she hasn't called initiation or roaming hands (while asleep) sexual assault before.

If I was a dictator, I'd forbid guy from sleeping in a room with people.

Messed rabbit hole, though. An easy argument for a lawyer to make would be, "do you know you have sexomnia? Did you sleep beside this person knowing sexual assault was a realistic possibility? Did she make it known that she would view it as sexual assault?" If yes to all three, then maybe I could see a rape conviction.

It’s not the case anymore since the end of the cold war, but the main union CGT was financed by the USSR, some guys even stored weapons to prepare for a revolution, they even stole 5% of the paper production to send it to Cuba. I m not making things up. 

So people started not caring about unions because they were all about seizing the means of production.  posted to submission: 'One year is enough!': Anti-Macron protests continue in France

I typically call to verify parking, fees, fuel prices, and anything else I might need to know about (i.e. hangar space if it's supposed to hail - it might be limited and you might be screwed when weather shows up if you need the hangar). FBOs also usually like a heads up that you're coming if you're staying, they can get things like a rental car ready for you in advance and bring it out to the airplane when you park if they have time and they're expecting you. posted to submission: Moronic Monday

[20:34:10] Comment: dyz10mj by PokeFluteFactory : I had PRK done about 4 years ago in Wilmington. I paid about $3000 too. My vision is still better than 20/20 and I’m in my late 20’s. My doctor told me I will eventually need readers due to aging. He recommended PRK over LASIK because there is a potential risk of damaging the “flap” (the outer epithelium) due to possible trauma. His example to me was that he had a patient that got hit in the eye and her flap became wrinkled and she had to have surgery to smooth it out. With PRK they remove the outer epithelial layer, use the lasers to correct your vision, and you leave with a protective lens over your eyes. The longer healing is due to your cells rebuilding the epithelial layer. You wear the protective lens for a week, there is some dryness/discomfort with that by the end of the week. As another redditor mention you do have tons of drops to use as part of the after care. They do give you numbing drops to help with any discomfort. My doctor advised me to use them as little as possible because they may delay the healing time. I may have only had to use them once. I remember it being uncomfortable at times but nothing too scarring. 4 years later no issues with any dryness. Allergy season is a breeze now, no dry eyes from wearing contacts! 10/10 would recommend and I wish I would’ve done it sooner too.  posted to submission: Has anyone had PRK laser eye surgery?

Almost two years ago, we lost our apartment. The church helped initially and payed for our hotel room while we looking for another place.

We stayed in the hotel for about two weeks and we no luck. My dad tried talking to our bishop so we could get some help. But the bishop/tscc refused and offered us food instead. This made my parents furious but then that fury quickly became sadness and resentment.

A few days go by and it was time for us to leave. My mother, siblings and myself left to stay with my grandparents. Mydad had no choice but to stay behind so he could work.

[20:35:04] Comment: dyz10n1 by Thameos : I mean you can definitely still play rs for fun without being too concerned about efficiency. Plenty of people still do even if the meta is different. 

At the end of the day we're all playing a medieval sandbox rpg that's nearly 20 years old where pretty much anything can be achieved if you put enough time into the game regardless of how "efficient" your methods are. I get that a number of people have fun going for the maximum xp/hr possible, but I feel like there's quite a large group of people gets dragged alongside the meta. Even though they'd have more fun messing around and not being overly concerned about efficiency they get dragged along with the meta. 

If you personally miss the days when people used to play for fun, find group of players not obsessed with efficiency and just do w/e you want. I sometimes enjoy going around slaughtering dragons with a dhcb (that arent vork, brutals, or kbd) just for shits and giggles.

And you won't know that if you dismiss it as "alt-right fanboys who hate brown people".  Right here you're learning that it's not just that.  I was born in the Middle-East.  I don't hate brown people.  They're literally my parents, brothers, sisters and friends.  I have other reasons for my views, but you don't know what they are.  My point is that your viewpoint is inaccurate -- you've built a simple caricature of the "ignorant redneck" and replaced the need to substantiate your worldview.  

Honest question, how many conservatives do you know and speak to on a regular basis?  Is it fair to say zero?

Same. But usually it's usually hard to find women in those areas, which is the problem. If this is the case, you either have to learn how to garner interest in these areas from other people, or expand your interests into more mainstream things. It's hard to do the former if you have social anxiety, or any other related issues, and it's also hard to do the latter if (like you said) you simply don't have those interests.

It's hard for a lot of people to accept that normies are usually the ones that have more friends and relationships, but it's true. But the response should not be anger towards others, like many incels and NiceGuys express. posted to submission: Take with a cup of water

Eventually, it becomes my habit , then I got inspired by my fellow gym mates to gain a lot of mass hahaha I have spend so much (too much?) money on this, but  my progress is so slow. I started at 53 Kg 4 years ago and now I'm 70 kg. But I never quit somehow. Maybe it's because this is the only productive activity that I have right now Hahahaha  how about you ?

[20:36:30] Comment: dyz18mn by I_Dont_Check_PMs : What's always seemed sad to me is people being irrational and ignorant enough to think that greek life is "paying for friends." When you live in a dorm and meet people there, are you "paying for friends"? No, and neither are you when you live in a Greek house. They have their "groups" that hang out together just like dorms do, and any other social club does. 

What you "pay" for is a much more fun and engaging college experience. Lots of parties and social events like almost every weekend, which is much more preferable to sitting around in dorms all the time. posted to submission: Greek life at colleges is toxic

Yes, this is incredibly obvious, and nothing in your original post implied any other way. So it's pretty ridiculous how many replied to you with explanations of how you won't find love doing this - as if you ever said you were trying to? Or all those replies flat out telling you not to do it.

Why are you switching apartments to one whose new rent is higher?

> should I refinance prior to me selling the car, or on the remaining balance? It seems like on the remaining balance would make for a smaller payment.

Assuming you are upside down on the car, you will need to come up with that money before your lender will let you sell it.  If you do not have the money on hand, usually easiest through a personal loan at your bank or credit union.   posted to submission: Question about these two budgeting scenarios.

Don't want people to misunderstand me, I like Luka, he's my favorite player in the draft, but he's got some significant weaknesses.

[20:41:33] Comment: dyz1mcn by NoAstronomer : (this is during TBC rather than Vanilla, but it's all vanilla content, sue me)

I mained an Enhancement Tauren Shaman. I remember tanking Blackfathom Depths because the tank dropped and we had trouble finding another. So we found another DPS and I tanked. I remember spending a week going in and out of Undercity via the bat entrance because I could not find the main entrance.

But what I remember the most was hitting level 40. Level 40 was a huge, huge, milestone for an Enchancement Shaman. I was in Stromgarde Keep killing ogres and I was so close I just farmed them for 20 minutes. Level 40 opened up ...

1. Riding. I had enough gold from farming herbs to pay for training but not the mount.

2. Mail armor, rather than leather

3. Dual-wield

I even had a couple of daggers stashed ready to use. Except I had never trained the weapon skill up. So I equipped them and went to town on a level 8 boar outside Orgrimmar, which promptly killed me. Oops.

they need to file the claim with the post office or with the police. 

if your item is low-cost and isn't that much of a liability to you and if you want to go an extra mile for the buyer, you can of course ship it again.

[20:43:22] Comment: dyz1mds by Brightlinger : I agree that you can have an effective program that doesn't include pullups and OHP, but it does not follow that you can take any existing program and just omit them while still getting equally good results.

Taking GSLP and modifying it to do bench and rows every session means you're now trying to add weight twice as fast, and you have less time to recover before hitting the movement again. While there's no muscle group that is outright neglected, that doesn't make it equivalent; for example, rows provide much less stimulus for the biceps due to the overhand grip and shorter ROM at the elbow, and doing nothing but flat bench for pressing work often leads to rotator cuff issues. posted to submission: I am going to start lifting using the recommended beginner program in the FAQ. Will omitting certain lifts/not switching it up be a huge detriment?

[20:43:32] Comment: dyz1mdy by tg110e5 : I didn’t like Kante, he played the same position as Matic but any chance he gets he would sprint up the field, trying to involve himself in the offensive play leaving KDB to play CDM. It really pissed me off, I had him set to “stay back while attacking and never did give and goes with him.

[20:43:44] Comment: dyz1me7 by platocplx : Yeah they should start tristan, When i re-watched the game having tristan on horford on one end and then forcing baynes to cover love on the other will help the cavs a lot. 

Love is able to really do what ever he wants vs baynes even drive on him. Love is gonna kick himself when he was matched up with baynes. One play he started a drive and stoped short for a jumper he shouldve kept driving and wouldve got a layup easily for example.

We probally will see some nance in this series as a relief for guys.  posted to submission: Key question facing Cavaliers: Start Tristan Thompson to neutralize Al Horford, or try making more 3s?

[20:45:24] Comment: dyz1up5 by SandyDelights : Close.

It shows you a picture (or set of pictures) that it knows the answers to, and a second set that it does not.

Nothing says it knows the answers to the first set and not the second; instead, it may know the answers to the second set and not the first.

Usually when I see these "select all that have *object*" captchas it's a 2x3 or similarly sized grid; in these instances, it knows the answers to approximately half of the pictures. Which half, we as users do not know. It may be the first 3, or the last 3, or the odd number ones, or the even number ones, or any combination of {0, 1, ... , 5}. posted to submission: sad

But I would have to think that for a general consumer, a front facing camera (for selfies, a mirror, video communication/chatting or making personal videos, scrolling while you look, unlocking phones, spying behind you - lol) will hold more weight than an extra <cm of space on a screen. 

I could be wrong. That being said I would most certainly love an under the screen camera. Not sure how that would work out.   posted to submission: Lenovo teases what might be the first true "all screen" phone.

[20:45:45] Comment: dyz1uph by Fourmoonslightshow : I admit that I spent some time wondering about the veiled threat part. I didn't get it at first, because I wrote this knowing that the person will never see this. To put it bluntly, the person prefers 4chan to Reddit and thinks Reddit is a left echo chamber safe space. Even if the person does or did use Reddit, the person would not use this subreddit as it is moderated to be a safe space. To take your assumption one step further, even if the person does use reddit and this subreddit, the chances of the person stumbling across this particular post at 10 or so last night when the person works nights is even less. Lastly, the person doesn't know my reddit username and I purposely delete everything over a week old so on the off chance that someone I know does come across my profile, they can't use my history to know that it is me. Lastly, I bounce between a few subreddits on purpose. I also use several usernames. I don't want people to find me and I certainly don't want this person to find me.

I won't re-edit or apologize for my first response, because your assumption was ridiculous and I am more than allowed to recognize that I can do major damage to someone's life, but choose not to do so.

>I think he’d benefit from a support group for children at some point as well. He already had trouble relating to children his age and this is just going to make things so much worse.

I lost my dad when I was very young and these were the two things that really helped me:
-Going to a grief support center that was exclusively for kids/teens, as opposed to an independent counselor's office.
-Going to grief camp. It was like a normal summer camp, except every kid there knew what it was like to lose a loved one.

While my school friends and teachers were compassionate, I really needed to be in an environment with a lot of other kids, teens, and adults who had been through the exact same thing.  posted to submission: My son’s dad died

Sure it does! Maybe some mech calipers have horrible range, but these Hayes Expert can be adjusted more than the entire thickness of the pad. 

So long as you center the calipers with new pads, you've got plenty of adjustment to account for wear. The installation instructions actually call for both adding a spacer _and_ backing off the inboard pad after centering, but I preferred to keep closer tolerances.

[20:48:56] Comment: dyz20r2 by brassmantv : `do-release-upgrade` is not officially supported until the .1 release comes out in July.  It's *recommended* that you wait until then before you upgrade from 16.04 to 18.04.

That being said, there are ways you could try to do it:

- Upgrade to 17.10, then 18.04  (change the release upgrader in `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades` to "normal" and do the `sudo do-release-upgrade` command...repeat

- Use the "Debian method" make sure *everything* is up to date first, then change your sources from "xenial" to "bionic" then `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade`

- Fresh install

**Please note that the *actual* recommendation is that you wait for the .1 update**

If you do choose to do this anyway, make sure you backup any important data.  posted to submission: unsure how to upgrade from 16.04LTS to 18.04LTS

If you use logic and evidence to decide things, then there is no more reason to believe the bible to be true (or the quran etc) than to believe somebody saying cleopatra liked to be called jessica.

[20:49:36] Comment: dyz2616 by Vertisce : I think gaming in general, especially MMO gaming started a hard decline when WoW came out.  Then everybody wanted a piece of the "low effort, high reward" pie.

CIG is breaking that mold.  Doing what has to be done to get the job done until it's done.  As long as it takes.

The good games that are coming out today are from companies like CDProject Red who value a good product for the players over their bottom line and how much they can rake their customers over for. posted to submission: Honest question...what happens if i pledge, and the game is never released ie: gets canceled?

I was nearly empty...so after doing some thargoid hunting, i wanted to chill a bit and did 2 main activities which i cycled between.

1) Undermining Felicia winters for merits
2) Doing sightseeing missions.

As a force of habit, i tend to stop on every USS i encounter...

I have been thinking about this topic  as well, I have a few questions if you don't mind:

* What kind of insurance would be best? WL / UL?
* What's approximately the cost \(and does it go on forever, does it go up every year\)?
* Does the cost vary, based on what, genetics? For adult, they ask things like historical health issue, smoke, etc, most of which probably won't apply for kids?

[20:51:54] Comment: dyz262t by blood-and-ashes : Many people have had success with anti\-dandruff shampoos. Nizoral in particular has been effective for a lot of people. There are also quite a few products that are considered fungal acne safe, meaning they won't feed the yeast species that has been identified as the culprit for this condition. You can try switching to a routine using only these products and see if you find any relief. Here's a link to a master list:

This is just a rehash of how the [UK stole countries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTduy7Qkvk8).  Israel doesnt get to claim Palestine because "they dont have a flag."  By taking it from Jordan Israel doesnt inherit their claim.  The same logic that made Jordans annexation of Palestine illegal makes Israel annexation of Palestine illegal.  At least Jordans claim was that the Palestinian delegation asked to be annexed by Jordan.  Israel has no such defense for their blatant land theft.   posted to submission: Israelis kill 18 Palestinians in Gaza protesting U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem

Next he has to warn his employees of an inspection. - You're losing me

[20:54:37] Comment: dyz2ejp by YourSpecialGuest : I don’t deny that certain demographics enjoy a more lenient treatment under the law for a multitude of reasons but respectfully, there are two reasons why I’m right and you are not. 

First, context. The argument that “White people, rich people, and corporations *are* protected classes as shown through the ***application*** of the law” is immediately preceded by the contrarian claim of “horseshit” which is clearly directed at the argument above it that states “Racist dipshits arent a protected class, so anyone and everyone can and should refuse service to them.” Just from context, it’s clear that the second argument can only refute the first argument by making the assumption that “racist dipshits” are “white people, rich people, and corporations” and are therefore a protected class, a direct contradiction of the initial premise presented in the first comment. The inference of that assumption is about as straight forward as it gets wrt logic. That’s the meat of it.

The second point has to do with the semantics of “application” and your assumption about race being the dominating factor in said “application” when there are other mediating factors that play an important role in our legal system I.e. organizational structure wrt to companies or competent legal representation wrt to rich people or demographic / geographic trends wrt enforcement by police (which you may or may not consider separate from “application” depending on what you really mean). It’s really just a technical point that boils down to the assertion that you’re making too broad an assumption / generalization and that privilege / disadvantage are two side of the same coin depending on your frame of reference.

So again, I’m not denying the racial injustice that’s clearly present in our legal system— I’m keenly aware of it through my own anecdotal experiences in addition to the plethora of statistically significant data points that indicate as much. I’m attacking a misclassification of the argument anatomy which, in the context of a response to the initial argument, clearly makes a broad, faulty assumption which was *correctly* inferred by another user.

But uh, thanks for the free citation I guess? posted to submission: The Coffee Bean Refuses to Serve Man Making Racist Comments to Muslim Woman

It's not clear if they do allow opt-outs. While Reddit has reported they don't, my phone alert settings seem to hint you can. 

My Phone Alert Settings: https://imgur.com/a/OQhQrMu

Emergency Alert/President Alert is mandatory, along with it being in french, and the WPAS Test is specifically Canadian, the U.S. version is called WPA. So if it was truly mandatory, they wouldn't have given me those options. Hence the confusion.

I stress this issue because you've committed two very dangerous statements of exceptionalism that are exactly the same society uses to permit Alex Jones to continue committing crimes.

[20:57:03] Comment: dyz2my3 by joydeeann : I do this. I did track macros for a few months so I was at least vaguely familiar with what I was eating. However, I love working out, and I don't mind eating healthy, but tracking it made me want to stab my eyes out, it was just too time consuming and I knew it wasn't a sustainable habit. 

So instead I focus **every** meal around protein, I know how difficult it is to eat enough, so all meals and snacks center on that. 

I also weigh myself daily and track my weekly average. If my weight is generally going in the right direction at roughly the pace I want, then that's the end goal anyways, so I don't feel the need to track calories. If not I'll just make a mental note to eat more/less \(always more lol, bulking is hard\), and continue on.

Are Gnome users not allowed to criticize the software they use?

Your example would be correct as the topic is broad enough, charging standrd for cell phones.  But this is specifically for a KDE hackfest on their flagship desktop - Plasma.  I fail to see what GNOME could contribute in this hackfest especially given GNOME is doing CSD and KDE would like to do SSDs.

The correct place would be something like las.gnomeorg where we are talking about applications.  I just feel that threadjacking a topic specific to KDE to talk about GNOME when there are already so many threads about GNOME as it is being impolite.

You can't win if you're playing too much defense. Playing on offense, however, is kind of a form of defense because it forces your opponent to keep some players behind, since they'll otherwise lose if they don't keep enough people behind to defend their flag.

>Unless one team has a clear advantage in coordination or speed, the game turns into a sort of stalemate, with indecisive raids until one side makes a big gamble. By being prepared for this and capturing the attackers, the tide of the game will turn.

I'd say this more a result of playing on a wide open field than strategy. You need variety to break stalemates - multiple routes to the flag, ways to flank your opponents, to hide behind and sneak your way in, various obstacles, etc... 

All in all, I think the best strategy for a plain open field is to just keep half your players on defense and half on offense. Mix them up too - don't put all of your fastest players on offense, because you don't want to risk too many of them getting jailed, and your slower players can help to lure opponents away from the faster ones who will carry the flag.  posted to submission: CMV: Strategic defense, or more accurately “defend first, then attack,” is a superior strategy for Capture the Flag.

The truly interesting thing in America is that this arrangement isn't limited to the rich, or even moderately well-off. Pretty much anyone can gorge on sugary bullshit because it's so *cheap*.

It's really hard to get isolated protein-rich foods pre-packaged for [under ten cents a gram](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quest-Protein-Bar-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Dough-21g-Protein-4-Ct/52642266) (of protein), but snacks under the same constraints can easily be found for nearly [ONE CENT per gram](https://www.walmart.com/ip/The-Bakery-Mini-Apple-Pie-4-1-Count/24447268) (of sugar). posted to submission: Americans are fat because of their culture and diversity!

Were here to aid in fixing the game for release. All these issues may have taken longer to identify and fix if we were not here bitching about every little thing.

People complain about BSG 'wasting' their time with this or that. And they should fix the netcode instead. But than when people get incovienced all the sudden they need to drop everything their doing and recover people's progress. 

They don't owe us an uninterrupted gaming experience yet. They have stated so before you bought the game and continuing to state this to this point. You knew your account would be wiped on occasion.

[20:59:25] Comment: dyz2sf8 by jrodstrom : My issues concerning the Iran deal extend well beyond the cash infusion. 

Before we signed the Iran deal, Iran was barely a player in the middle east because their economy was in shambles. Since then:

* Iran has sent its Quds forces and Hezbollah to support Assad in Syria \- backing a genocidal strongman and the worst humanitarian crisis since WW2.
* Iran has funded terrorist groups in Yemen, that have forced their legitimate government into exile. These same rebels are now launching scud missiles at Riyadh..
* Iranian\-backed Hezbollah is now the second largest political party in Lebanon.
* Hamas \(another Iranian funded terrorist group\) has ramped up its attacks against Israelis and has garnered huge support in Gaza and the west bank.
* Iran has begun supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
* Continued to develop their ballistic missile program.

The Iran deal might have stopped Iran from developing a nuke. However, it also empowered them and made them the most powerful regional power in the middle east. They essentially saved Assad and have supported genocide in Syria all while propping up their various terrorist organizations to cause chaos and further their goals in the middle east. If you do not see this as a problem then I do not know what to tell you. The issue isn't just about nukes. It is about containing Iranian influence on the region. posted to submission: President Trump Puts 'America First' On Hold To Save Chinese Jobs

[20:59:52] Comment: dyz2sft by jaxisthere : If we can't have more loot, then we need to have better loot. But we don't have that either. Out of all the guns released in Leviathan and first Lair, what were the stand out guns?



Rocket Launcher - because it had cluster bombs and was slightly easier to farm than the vanguard one.


Handcannon - it had outlaw. Whooooo. Outlaw.



Sword - arguably the most unique out of all the loot, as it had the ability to go infinite ammo as long as you landed all 3 hits of the heavy attack. And then Bungie removed that ability.


So yeah, not only do we have less guns, we also have worse guns. Glad we went to this from D1. posted to submission: Loot re-skins make it feel like a game designer is mailing it in, so why should we try hard to obtain that armor?

[21:01:18] Comment: dyz2sgk by NicholasCueto : Yes. But my point is that you're acting like they wouldn't have access to specific data which isn't true. They have access to all of it if they have a subpoena. This also assumes that FISA courts operate in the same way as a normal court and also assumes that the requests for data are targeted very specifically. Neither of these are confirmable (and given that almost 99% of all FISA warrants have been given the green light) it would be a stretch to believe they aren't being abused or overused in some way. So given that we know the government can actively read what you retype on the Internet while you type it and also that theyve been collecting data since before 9/11, we can assume that when they ask for data from Google they probably aren't saying "hey can you give us 1 dossier on one person out of the billions of people you monitor?" 

No. They use a dragnet, say they need it for broad strokes purposes, and take it all. How could it be any other way? There would be literally millions of FISA court warrants. But we only see thousands. Can you provide a better explanation for that? posted to submission: Google under investigation for using Android phone data to spy on users

Source: Meth heads stripped an estimated $80k in scrap metal from a job site I was on in the middle of Toronto.  The vultures even tried to use blow torches to cut a ton and a half service elevator motor into chunks they could drag to a scrap yard and sell.

[21:02:54] Comment: dyz30tv by fuzzymooples : >they are not blocking anything.

You're correct, block is a misleading term as it sounds permanent which is not. Saying they're only a revising chamber is also misleading, they can also propose legislation. Lords can also serve in the cabinet (though rare enough now).

>A second chamber is a great idea and having it unelected is great as it means that it can take longer term views on legislation and expertise is often higher in the lords than the commons. I'm for reform (reduce number, change how people are appointed, limit terms for people being in the lords...), but keeping it a separate, unelected chamber is incredibly beneficial to our democracy.

I can't imagine an appointment system with enough checks that would make it not something to dole out to party hacks, ex MPs and friends in the business community. Expertise in the topic area is what permanent secretaries in ministries are for (though the civil service has its own problems). An unelected house that can delay government legislation, amend it and propose it's own conflicts with the definition of democracy where it power lies with the people.

[21:03:19] Comment: dyz30u2 by zdfld : It was said in a light hearted interview with Aaron Ramsey, where they asked who the teacher's pet was. That's really the only time it's ever been mentioned. 

We have absolutely no information for how often it happens. It could have just happened once and Ramsey was recalling/exaggerating that event, it could happen every week. 

When he's been injured, he's been out for a while. Earlier in the season, he got injured, missed a game or two, came back, reinjured himself, missed the Chelsea game, and played as a sub in two games, than came back. These last 3 games his agent and Wenger have said he's had a continuous back injury which he can play through if needed, but since he wasn't needed he got the rest instead to be fresh ahead of the world cup. 

The times when he's out for a game is when he's sick, and honestly if you're used to getting once a year illnesses (I am), than you'd know they often are hell for 1 week than go away. I imagine in Ozil's case, he becomes sick enough where trying to play is a pain, so if it's not a crucial game, it's better to take the week off and get over it. 

Honestly, I don't think it's nearly as big a deal as people make it out to be.  posted to submission: Özil and Gündigan meet with Turkish president Erdogan

I understand the complications of creating constitutional basis for federations or unions, but at one point can we say something has failed in its objective? The US constitution is old, outdated and in need of revision but for some reason the document is placed on an almost religious footing and often deemed untouchable. Almost as if it is perfect, and in need of no changes. The office of President itself is rife with abuse, and Trump excellently proves this point. America created its own religion based on itself, and it is run by fundamentalists. posted to submission: President Trump just unveiled a new White House ‘faith’ office.

[21:04:09] Comment: dyz30ug by QuebecNorth : I just fail to see what's so useful about mobile payment. I mean if a big argument to show in what ways China is an advance country is that people are dependent on their mobile device to pay for shit, its not really impressive. 

If you have privacy concerns with mobile payment, you can just carry 100$ and pay by cash for your everyday expenses. 

If you use your credit card the same way you would use your bank card, meaning only spending money you already have, then you get the advantage (protection) with none of the disadvantages (fees, encouraging spending). 

I am happy i could still use other payment methods while i was in china (credit card, cash) and didnt have to rely on complicated mobile payment. To use mobile payment it required to have a Chinese bank account, which is not available to those with temporary visa like tourist or business. 

Also unlike credit card and cash, you cant 100% rely on it since if you drop your phone from 1meter high on the concrete there is a good chance it will break. cards and cash are much more reliable. 

To me it seem just a good way to spy on people's habits and profile them.

[21:05:02] Comment: dyz30v3 by Perpetuell : You're conflating logic/reason with truth. Logic is an imperfect tool because like you said, it's reliant on predefined predicates that aren't necessarily based in reality. But that doesn't discount what is, it's only a limitation on our ability to understand it.

There is objective morality, it's just highly situational. Like one of the things about logic/reasoning in regards to morality you might be misunderstanding is that some people might base some of their morals on the predication that killing is wrong. But if they delve too long on it, they'll run into the same problem that you have and realize that that's not true for all instances. So whenever something like that happens too often and reckoning a consistent basis becomes too difficult, they might start thinking nothing can ever make complete sense and there will always an underlining faulty assumption for any given thought..

Buuut, I'd say it's just more complicated than people are able to consistently think through considering how many different instances there are. But there *is* an objectively correct course of action/reasoning for any given scenario.

But yeah ofc virtually all human interaction is "illogical" whenever you apply that kind of frame to it. It tends to make more sense when you apply the frame that we were originally just another species trying to survive and get laid before we started making societies and actually getting around to utilizing our sapience.

Ezra's reassurances were interrupted by the sound of the Heart's sonic boom and a dull radiance of spatial pressure that crashed into his khes like a wave. The force of it was great enough to lift the palaar slightly in Corvus' arms. It was slightly painful, but not enough to grimace at--boring a hole through the mountain was worse, at any rate.

The mirror lake heaved, and from its center expanded a peculiar ripple. The color was different, and the reflections changed within its border. But were those even reflections? They weren't, Ezra realized. This was something else.

Holy fuck. Republicans have to ruin everything, now they are ruining history. King Cyrus is perhaps the most universally-beloved figure from antiquity - for good reason.

[21:06:10] Comment: dyz395u by MN- : OK you're right, I shouldn't say people are just disagreeing me because it's the internet.  People have a valid disagreement with what I am saying, and I shouldn't blow it off.

My feelings and decisions are based on my experience, just like anyone else's...  I do feel like a lot of the hate I'm getting is from people who do not have children and have not faced this decision.  Maybe other people in my exact same situation would try to get their wife to just enjoy being with her mother in law all day so that they can make their own mom happy... I don't know.

What I do know is that I want mother's day to be great for my wife, the mother of my children.   I came to a point where I realized that doing what my mom wanted for mother's day and what my wife wanted were not compatible, and I chose my wife's version instead.  If other people would choose to make their wife unhappy to appease their mom, that is their own decision.  That was the decision I felt I had to make.  I do not regret it.

Not trying to get /r/raisedbynarcissists/ to leak all over here, but just for an example... When I buy my mom a birthday present, (which I do, every year, and always have since I was probably 13 or 14) she says "No one ever celebrated my birthday growing up" and has also (multiple times, but not EVERY time) said "I have never received a gift for my birthday before".   Now grant it, this is done in a voice of appreciation, like "wow, this is amazing" but I am extremely offended by it because in my head she's saying "YOU have never gotten me a present before" which is both fucked up and untrue.

We do not have a terrible relationship.  We are totally fine.  I just choose to not be around her on Mother's day. posted to submission: No excuse will be good enough.

I ran a Tutorial in the start of the city which centered around helping a poor man and his daughter settle his debt with a local criminal gang. 

I let them make mistakes and we all took it as a chance to learn how the game works. I let them take things back if they wanted, change their characters sheet around if they overlooked something big.

Now the tutorial is over and I am teaching them a lot less and letting them make mistakes. I think it was good to give a grace period to them, and now I'm a lot more strict. posted to submission: Is it better to "baby" new players or just throw them into it?

[21:06:50] Comment: dyz396h by dfassna1 : In case anyone doesn't want to go to the link some people posted, here is what the guy who recorded the video said:

>I recorded this video. There was a party at this house and the cops shut it down so the house owner was trying to tell the people still standing in the yard to leave and the girl that was screaming at the end apparently really did not want to leave because she was screaming at the house owner and talking shit to her. ""stone hands" is good friends with the house owner and the majority of the crowd." while the girl was arguing with the house owner her boyfriend decided to chime in and started arguing with stone hands and the others. stone hands and the girls boyfriend then both agreed to fight. stone hands put his hands up and the other guy did not so stone hands then asks him if he is ready and he replies yes so stone hands put him to sleep. The 2 people that got knocked out lost pretty much all motor skills for about 25 mins they couldn't walk or talk right. Also right before i started recording this video i was recording the girl yelling at the house owner and the second guy that got knocked out came up to me and took my go pro away from me and told me "some things we go pro and some things we don't" once he finally gave my camera back i started recording and the fight happened. posted to submission: HMB while I fight anyone who wants to at this party.

[21:07:02] Comment: dyz396r by JustWormholeThings : Eh, you're right of course about the physiological effects.  However, it seems plausible that panic could kill alot of people who suffer one, and plausible that panic and the subsequent adrenaline could be far more dangerous (i.e. higher heart-rate, blood-pressure etc.) than the increase caused by pot.  Plus, to avoid another heart attack, quitting smoking pot would be as effective as avoiding excitement or any heart race increasing substance (coffee).  There are more important areas of lifestyle change that need to take place.  Unless of course he's the sort of stoner who gets high and eats a ton of garbage food and never exercises.  If he has to quit pot to change those things, well yeah, that should be a priority. posted to submission: Kevin Smith is going to be on the podcast next week hopefully it will be at least 4 hours.

[21:07:04] Comment: dyz396t by gypsytoy : > I think we can all agree Bitcoin gold, Bitcoin diamond, Bitcoin private etc are definitely not the same as Bitcoin core or Bitcoin cash in terms of significance.
> 
> 

No, one category is Bitcoin, which is BTC itself. The rest fall into the category of "Bitcoin Forks", which are alts by definition. There's only one Bitcoin and its the one that kept the network and usebase. All others are wannabes, aka alts. 


>Purely because Bitcoin cash is of significance it should be an open discussion. 

It's discussed in the alt thread, what more do you want? It's not Bitcoin and shouldn't be discussed in Bitcoin Markets daily thread. This has already been established by the mods. I don't understand why you're arguing. They set up a specific thread for you people. 


>In terms of price, hashrate, community support, exchange volume, it is of huge significance.

Lol, no it's not. It's 1/6th the price. It's not even #2 or #3 coin. Plus, at the moment it's price is unreasonably high because of fork hype. For the most part it's more like 1/10th the value of Bitcoin (and that's based on significantly worse liquidity, so the number is inflated). It's hashrate is the same story. Far below that of BTC (and only exists because Jihan took advantage of the EDA and propped up the coin in the beginning). It's 'community' is largely uninformed and composed of trolls who downvote any decent. A quick glance at rBTC reveals that cancer. Exchange volume is extremely low and only pumps when exhanges give access to coins and people dump them. Other than that, volume is pretty weak, especially this recent pump. 

Also, the TXs are just absolutely terrible. BTC is doing like 15x the number of transaction BCH does. Segwit alone is doing far more than BCH. 

Your narrative doesn't add up, which is why this talk belongs in the Alt Discussion thread. Please move this discussion to there, as per the rules. posted to submission: [Daily Discussion] Monday, May 14, 2018

[21:07:22] Comment: dyz396y by ipunkimunki : Even though it wasn't announced as such, the double XP weekend last year was more done as an apology to the community for the lame Anniversary event than anything else. It involved an impossible amount of dance emotes and skins to grind since it was still possible to get duplicates back then (why hello Cruiser DVA for the third time! Oh, Hanzo's dance yet again? It's okay, this 50 currency is worth way more than getting the rest of the hero dances - just fifteen more duplicate dance emotes and I can buy the one that I want!). Also there was no real "event" and it felt really lame to celebrate the milestone of the game's first anniversary by playing... Total Mayhem. And, as much as it's a small thing, the overall effort of the Anniversary event was encapsulated by the player icons we got: all standard hero icons except with black backgrounds and gold gradients. It all just felt extremely lazy and greedy after the amazing Uprising event and there was a huge backlash from the community.

Considering they're being much more generous with the anniversary event this year than they were last year, they could go either way. Either they're being generous enough that they see no reason to give another double XP weekend or they're generous enough that they do the double XP weekend on top of everything else. posted to submission: Double XP

I was telling a friend about his melt down and she went to look at his FB and she told me about the FB post which was right after his melt down - which was obviously about me. So that's it in a nutshell.  posted to submission: Oh shit.

[21:08:30] Comment: dyz3esk by izaya3000 : It's not worth the effort in explaining that I understand someone committing suicide. 

If I hear that someone committed suicide because of their depression, bipolarity, anxiety, etcetera, I don't blame them and say "well what about their families? What a selfish decision."

Chances are, if you live with any of those illnesses (or multiple), life day to day is extremely hard. I get it, because that's how I feel all the time.  posted to submission: OK Reddit - What just isn't worth the effort?

[21:09:27] Comment: dyz3hxj by TheWoodBotherer : That's a classic 'Heffalump Trap' thought process!

The reward for not drinking can't be drinking, it just doesn't work...

It's still the same substance interacting with the same brain, and the consequences are still just as bad as they ever were...

The book/YouTube Channel '*This Naked Mind*' and the book '*Alcohol Explained*' really helped me understand my drinking problem, and gave me some useful tools to stop and *stay* stopped, without feeling like I was depriving myself or missing out on anything... Understanding a bit of the science behind the interaction between Alcohol and the human brain made a big difference!

I also found it helpful to explore the underlying emotional issues and difficult stuff that I was trying to blot out with drink, because that kind of thing doesn't just go away by magic when we stop drinking...

Hang in there, and Don't Feed The Booze Goblin!

[21:09:51] Comment: dyz3hy2 by YondaimeHokage4 : Yup. From what I've heard/read over the years sharks rarely, if ever, actually eat humans because they don't like the taste(Im not so sure that there is any evidence of a shark eating an entire human). Most shark attacks, as you said, are them mistaking a human as a seal or large fish. Sharks tend to take a "test bite" before they eat something, which unfortunately is enough to kill someone or cause a bad injury. posted to submission: What is extremely rare but people think it’s very common?

Or how about DIY reddit's favorite son Wayne's (DIYorDIE) flavor concentrate ["funfetti og" label](http://lghttp.20915.nexcesscdn.net/809E49/magento/media/extendware/ewimageopt/media/inline/7e/c/funfetti-og-by-diyordie-cc6.jpg), is that child appealing?

[21:12:53] Comment: dyz3i0d by bubbuty : Season both sides of chicken tenders with Montreal chicken seasoning. Then take aluminum foil and make tents out of them (basically you shape them into a boat, pinching them up on both sides). Put the chicken in the aluminum foil boatsand pour in a couple tablespoons of reduced sodium soy sauce. Fold the sides of the boats together so they are sealed like a tent, leaving some room at the top. Bake for 15 minutes at 375 degrees. For the tendon in the chicken tender, you can shred the chicken at the end along the tendon and then tear the tendon out. You waste less chicken and make less mess that way. 

This delicious, especially considering there is no oil. I put it in salads and all kinds of dishes. Enjoy!  posted to submission: Delicious no-oil chicken breast

[21:13:06] Comment: dyz3qcm by pyrogerg : Experiment what part of your index finger you're using to create the barre. I'll also pass on some advice about barre chords in general from Martin Taylor, a great jazz guitarist and teacher. He says beginners often struggle with barre chords because they're focusing on getting all the strings to ring with the barre before they put down the other notes, and that a better strategy is to put down the non-barred notes first and then work on getting the barred notes to ring clear. posted to submission: Having issue with B7

I think most people these days think of them as basically equivalent, but some, older people especially, might still look at email as more casual and be upset getting major information that way. Especially if it is a group email and not individualized.

[21:15:12] Comment: dyz3qe4 by nomnomnombacon7 : I chose to be a stay at home mom because we moved when I was six months pregnant and it wouldn't have worked well for me finding a new job just to turn around and go on maternity leave shortly after. I had no job to return to and any job that I did get would have barely covered the cost of daycare. To me, it wasn't worth it. I love being home with my daughter and watching her grow. That being said, if I had had a job that I loved and got to have a break from baby life two days a week, I absolutely would have gone back. Sometimes when my kid is being a little butthead, I wish that I would have found a job lol. The best advice I was given was to make time for myself. Being a mom is hard work. Your husband will never understand. Do what you think is best. Because if you're unhappy being at home, it will affect your new little one. You may also get towards the end of maternity leave and feel like you don't want to leave your little one and choose to stay home. But give yourself the option. Do what's best for you and your family. It's not about the money, it's about your family's happiness.  posted to submission: Daycare if being a sahm is financially better?

[21:16:10] Comment: dyz3qez by lankyskanky : >What are you seeing that is keeping him on your squad?

Uhh how about the fact that if you have him you likely spent a 5th round pick on him and he barely has 50 plate appearances. 

You can argue he was way overdrafted(he was) but regardless dropping that high of a pick after this small of a sample is bad process.

His BABIP is 80 points off his career average and he was on well over a 40 steal pace before his DL trip.

I've played with plenty of people that just laugh about using racial slurs, it doesn't offend them at all. So it wouldn't be accurate to assume that everybody you play with (or even most) will be offended.

And if they are, you just apologise and move on if you're decent. Interestingly, the OP never told the crew he was playing with that what they were saying bothered him, and instead chose to be an asshole himself. posted to submission: To the Solo Sloop Running Away

Huh.  That's literally the reason you're supposed to get a breakaway collar for a cat.  Only cats are expected to get themselves into tight spaces that something might get caught up on causing them to choke.  I'm having a hard time imagining a necklace in that kind of situation.  On the other hand, it'd be very handy if someone tries to steal your necklace, better to let it snap easily than potentially wreck your neck (or drag you along) in the process. posted to submission: Map stabbers have to be stopped!

[21:19:26] Comment: dyz44n2 by venusprefers : Don't discount the thrift store!  They might not have the brand names that everyone talks about (but then again, they might!), but you should be able to get the basics for cheap to try everything out.

I got a full set of baselayers for $10 (Danskin top and cuddleduds bottom).  They're an ounce or two heavier than the patagonia models, but they were also 20 times less expensive!  It's a great way to try lightweight and see if it works.  If not, you're only out $10 and you can go back and try a midweight.

Also, all basic fleece is essentially the same material.  What you're paying for is the cut and sewing, and of course a brand name.  This means that any thrift store fleece that fits you is just as good as anything else that you'd pay full price for.  Things like zippers, pockets and other embellishments will add to the weight, so look for half zips with no pockets if you want the lightest.  I got an Eddie Bauer full zip that weighs 10 oz for $7 practically brand new. posted to submission: Brand-Spankin' New Backpacker looking for recommendations on womens clothing!

[21:19:47] Comment: dyz44ns by Gem-Merchant : it's also significantly easier to play, and by far the lowest skill cap DPS job in the game. if RDM gets any rdps increase it should be by way of breaking some of the strangleholds certain jobs have over party composition.

as an example, instead of any stupid stackable nonsense, RDM could just get a Trick Attack-equivalent that carries antibody like Virus used to. basically, anything RDM gets should probably be looked at under that lens, rather than just making a new party buff monster and calling it "balance". 

there is not, however, any universe where current RDM requires enough skill to deserve to outdamage any other dps job in the game. posted to submission: [Megathread] Letter from the Producer LIVE Part XLIV

News media is pushing the BS blue wave story is trying to say it's something that happens historically after a pres election. Yes, it did, when we elected narcoleptics like Jeb and other uniparty shitheads who said a lot and did nothing for 2 years and shit stayed the same.

Here you have GEOTUS who's brought the largest tax cut in generations \(crumbs!\), brought huge numbers of jobs back, people getting bonuses, economy growing 3\+&#37;, stock market to the moon, unemployment at record lows, 2 million fewer food stamps, illegal immigration smackdown, throwing China, Mexico and Canada on the mat and sitting on them until they squeal, moved our embassy to Jerusalem, kicked Iran in the balls and is bringing peace to the Korean peninsula for the first time in 70 years.

It could be anything from he didn't want to have children to he didn't think he would make a good dad. He could not even know the reason why himself.

[21:22:58] Comment: dyz4bie by Spheros : > Physical gender. The gender you are genetically born with which was the first link I provided which states there are genetic differences between males and females.

It's a good thing nobody is disputing that.

>Certain genes pertaining to gender are crossed between two genders, but there are still distinctive genetic code that are present at birth which determine your gender and will not under any circumstance change, hence true gender.

Where did 'true' gender come from? Why are you talking about 'true' gender as if it is somehow more valid than how a person feels in their mind? 

>Yes, and being born your true gender still remains true.

Again, you're being facetious. Nobody was ever arguing that people are born as a certain gender, genetically, but that psychologically transgender people may feel like a stranger in their own body. I'm actually shocked you thought that Democrats believe that people change their genetic gender out of the blue. 

>Ahh but you see you stupid fuck I don't think you realize you are referring to nonexistent stories covered by tabloid news outlets for clickbait.

LMAO. Freedom fries was a tabloid news outlet? The Dixie Chicks was tabloids? And yet your sources are somehow super valid and not from right wing dumpster fires? YOU ARE A FUCKING HYPOCRITE. 

>Violent protests regarding Trump were not by a minority, they were by hundreds of thousands of people. 

And violent protests by the alt right have actually killed people. So far you guys have one upped us. Unless Charlottesville was a hoax? Remember? That time conservatives marched with tiki torches? 

>Considering you dipshits with Trump derangement syndrome still can't get over the fact that he won, it isn't generalization at all. It's reality.

LOL. I knew he was going to win. This is the same country that elected Bush twice. I stopped being surprised over a decadea go.

>Trump can take as many golf trips as he wants. He's already accomplishing more of his agenda than Obama in his first term.

Hahaha. He has literally not done anything except pass a shitty tax bill that will increase the deficit by trillions of dollars. And now he's taking credit for North Korea despite him having almost nothing to do with it. For a president who has all of congress and the senate on his side, he sure is ineffectual. Trump will go down as the worst president in U.S history. 

>They didn't have nuclear weapons at that point and Obama's foreign policy on North Korea was literally to take a backseat approach.

Obama oversaw the released of just as many North Korean prisoners as Trump has. Oh, I guess you mean he didn't try to start a nuclear war over Twitter, like that demented turd we currently have in office. At least Obama didn't fall asleep mid tweet. LOL.

[21:23:48] Comment: dyz4biu by FudgieThaWhale : Sure! Take TEL and GVT as examples (both I’m holding long on). Both have enormous upside potential considering price, ambition, and general drive of the team. I see them as long holds because while I could short play them for smaller 20-30% trades I would rather see them at their peak potential in a year or more at the prices I think they can reach. Those potential highs outweigh the possible short term gains imo. 

For medium to short plays I apply the same logic. Something that has good TA and a potential small 10%+ pump coming soon I’ll pick up as a short play and the same for medium if I see something in the near but not immediate future. 

There are no tell tale signs for this, it’s more gut instinct and person preference/belief. I see GVT becoming a 4+ digit value coin in the long term, so I hold it. I see REP making a 20%+ move in the near term, so I hold it for a short play (got 5% on it already actually, as of writing).  posted to submission: How much should I invest in 2018 to become a millionaire in 2019?

[21:24:09] Comment: dyz4bj9 by Route66_LANparty : The short answer is **Yes**. They are both solid entry points and good value for Necron Units. Alone or together depending on how many points and what style army you are trying to jump into and play. The older start collecting box is solid value as well if you can still find it.

If you plan to swarm/horde with Necron Warriors, I'd also recommend eBay or /r/miniswap to pickup warriors already assembled on the cheap.

For starting out... You just need to focus on setting up a Battalion Detachment and play a bit. That's 2-3x HQ units (Cryptek from Forgebane, Overlord from Start Collecting, and/or Command Barge from start collecting). And 3-6x Troop units (Warriors from Start Collecting or Immortals from either). Buying both gets you what you need to really get started. posted to submission: Gretchin's Questions - Beginner Questions for Getting Started - May 14, 2018
[21:24:10] Comment: dyz4bja by chocolate787 : My little brother invited his friend over one time to play board games. Throughout the game his friend would touch him affectionately and at one point leaned his head on my brother's shoulder. 

My first thought was that he's probably gay, but then I realized throughout the night that he is very much so straight and was just showing my brother genuine affection of being his friend. It was refreshing to see a guy act the way my friends and I would and not care about how men are "supposed to act" towards other men.

Guilt over Hitler is very real in German.  Why is it wrong to include Hitler when the topic of the segment of the clip is literally about Hitler??

If PragerU and Douglas Murray wanted to smear Merkel with visuals there are much much better and more evil dictators to put her next too.  Mao and Stalin being the most obvious and fitting as they are 'communist' dictators and have larger kill counts. Merkle is much closer to a communist dictator that advocates soft genocide not an authoritarian dictator that kills with more direct actions. posted to submission: The Suicide of Europe

It seemed like the dad manipulated Maureen a lot, and put the two of them at odds with each other (telling Maureen all his money went to paying for Henry's college and that's why there was none left for her)  posted to submission: Henry should have bitch slapped Maureen

[21:25:52] Comment: dyz4l2g by wholesomefantasy : I would get rid of the first paragraph. Sorry if that comes off harsh, but it doesn't serve any purpose for your story. It's hard to care for a girl with no name, and no idea what she's running from. 

Starting into the second paragraph, you start zoomed out with an omniscient lens. Which I'm not sure is what you want. I'd start by writing the characters names outright, instead of 'they', 'her', 'she'. This piece seems to by from Eyrs perspective anyhow. You also start with describing the character's outfits which sucked me out of the story. It serves no purpose, we get to picture the characters a bit more once the bar patrons & Renn notice them anyhow, and it's much more natural that way.

The dialogue is not bad, though the scene in the bar progresses a bit too fast to feel completely natural. I think you could fix this by having Eyrs notice more things, and have more internal reactions to what is happening, and being said. This should help provide more tension, and help color the characters a bit more.

Overall, the story is not bad man, I'd like to know what happens when three odd companions go to lift the curse. I hope I helped a little :\). posted to submission: Mistwalker - Intro and first scene[1670 words]

[21:28:20] Comment: dyz4re3 by chaos750 : I think you're interpreting it backwards from how it's intended. The primary thing is whether distress is occurring for the person. The society around the dress-wearing man is only relevant in that it can have a negative effect on his mental state. He's only "mentally ill" if his intolerant society is depressing him or making him feel isolated and alone or something else. If he's in that society but holding strong and doing great despite the intolerance, he's not suffering from any mental illness. Similarly, if he moved to a big city where no one cared about his dress, but was still feeling bad about it, he could have a mental illness *despite* how society treats him.  posted to submission: Mhmm

A guy in my school says he' only still in school because he can get student support while pursuing his streaming career. He's the most unlikable asshole on the planet. He constantly interrupts teachers to make some stupid comment about how little he cares, he downs 6 monster energy drinks every day, if he sits right in front of you your entire personal space will be filled with an odor that can only be described as a weirdly stiff sock found under a teenagers bed.

Well, does he make sense without supervillains?

> Neither is your opinion that he doesn't do anything for Gotham. It might be popular, but it's still wrong. Batman isn't insane, he's fully aware of his actions and understands the consequences. He knows the difference between good and bad, and does his best to choose good at the expense of himself. He act in a way that seems crazy, but clearly is a necessity. To say otherwise is wrong.

He doesn't have a secret identity. He *is* Batman and "Bruce Wayne" is just a cover. He has no hobbies, no life outside of being Batman. All his relationships are work-related and he still makes a mess of them. The man is making a mockery of law and order and thinks he's doing good. And, again, there's all that torture. 

> ignore the fact the spends billions on the root causes of crime

Minus the billions more that he spends on being Batman.

> Gotham has systemic problems that he dismantled, namely organized crime, that isn't going to be stopped by charity work. 

Why wouldn't it? If children in problem areas got the educations and job opportunities they needed they wouldn't need to join gangs, and without gangs where would organized crime find its recruits? 

> They further have extensive corruption that isn't curved by charity work.

[21:31:07] Comment: dyz4wq6 by Spradic_Zoom : Our main disagreement then is that this unhealthy feature is currently necessary.  I don’t think that killers would flee if they were forced to occasionally play against SWF groups.  As I mentioned earlier, SWF balancing and lobby dodging fixes are independent issues, and solving one doesn’t solve the other.  On the contrary, I think treating them as related problems allows devs to be lazy and not implement fixes to either issue, using one bad design to justify more bad design.

My question is, what happens when we fix SWF to not be as broken, and dodging doesn’t go down?  Will we perpetually be kept hostage by killers that refuse to accept a challenge, threatening the “stability” of the player base if lobby dodging ever gets punished?  Will we have to nerf every survivor item that causes dodges before it’s ok to stop dodging?  Where do we draw the line? posted to submission: Dear Killers, stop quitting.

[21:31:27] Comment: dyz4wqc by binaryriot : With out-of-the-box tools this is probably tricky. At least here with my R16 I didn't had a smart idea yet. :)

We can do a 'Point-Level-Animation' for a single hole and then use a Cloner to generate the shape and use a Shader effector to control the PLA per hole... while this works nicely and gives pretty results it limits us to more simple shapes (which we can generate via a Cloner or multiple Cloner setup.)

https://external.binaryriot.org/site-reddit-com/2018.05/14_holes,1.mp4

----

An somewhat hacky alternative could be to 'Extrude Inner' all polygons (without preserving groups), so each polygon of the object gets a child polygon inside its center. Then we create a selection of those new polygons; add a "Shader Effector" as deformer (in Polygon deformer mode) and use a "Restriction" tag where we add the earlier polygon selection. While this should work nicely in principle my R16 seems to bug with it (polygons destort/ rotate during the process for some reason ;) ). To hide those polygons and create the 'holes' we add a 100% alpha transparency material on the polygon selection. Naturally this leads us to the second drawback of this method that we can't create polygonal thickness procedural (unless we make an static/non-animatable editable copy/variant).

https://external.binaryriot.org/site-reddit-com/2018.05/14_holes,2.mp4

----

Which leads us to a potential 3rd method which probably would lead to the best result: do it with some Python scripting. It needs the most preparation time. Sadly I miss this very time for that currently, so I can't demonstrate any form of proof-of-concept at this point.

… so I just throw this in as an idea. :D posted to submission: Variable Surface Patterns

[21:33:53] Comment: dyz4ws5 by AnewHeroEmerges : And that is a slippery slope of hell. If a rich person had to pay 1000$ or a parking ticket that's 5$ bucks then police for example would be incentivised to only hand out parking tickets on expensive cars. 

That being said I am all for the wealthy paying a percentage more in regards to taxes, etc. But income based tickets is not a good idea.  posted to submission: TIL Washington Redskins' owner Dan Snyder once cut down trees along the Potomac River so that he could see it from his house.

[21:33:59] Comment: dyz4ws4 by Warriorjrd : Oh look, a month later and all you have is another example of when the defence worked. You realize I never said it never works right? I said it is incredibly hard to make work. Obviously in this new case you just linked psychologists diagnosed him with an illness and it was able to be shown that said illness made him not know right from wrong. If they published the failed attempts of this defence for every time you link a successful one I can link 10 that failed. 

And the fact this defense exists is an example of our justice system working. Some people shouldn't be treated the same and sane people. Also note that a not criminally responsible verdict is not the same as a not guilty verdict. Not criminally responsible means they did the crime but won't face *criminal* charges. They still get a sentence, it's usually psychiatric treatment or a sentence in a psychiatric hospital.  posted to submission: Alek Minassian charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder in Toronto van attack

He just perused random generic conservative websites for any offensive content to "prove a point" about freedom of speech and people who claim to be open-minded. I can tell you flat out some of it is true, some is false, and a lot is exaggerated. For example "Patient 0" is actually bullshit. Some guy wrote the letter O, and someone thought it was the number 0. I believe AIDS was actually spread by vaccines initially. It is undeniable though that it's a grossly disproportionate problem in the homosexual community.﻿*

[21:35:22] Comment: dyz562p by Thesedays3780 : I don't have any real rules for myself for what I eat other than if it's sweets/junk food it has to be really satisfying to be worth eating it, and then I only eat until it crosses the line to "not satisfying enough." I will literally leave 2 bites of ice cream if I've gotten to the point of feeling like it's not satisfying enough anymore. I can have a package of Oreos in the house and not eat any of them before they're gone, and not feel deprived. 

Honestly, just asking myself "will this *really* be satisfying?" has been incredibly helpful. Sometimes it is (more in the past than currently), and that's totally fine and I don't judge myself for it.

When I first was trying to really cut back on sweets (years ago) I had a "rule" that if I wanted sweets, I had to eat a piece of fruit first. Most of the time, it satisfied my sweet tooth enough to skip the sugar, and I figured that the rest of the time at least I got the nutrients from the fruit.

China does X well, however, they have problem X, Z; therefore there is nothing we need to worry about.

well, these either serves to defect blame or making excuses for thr west’s own failing, which in the end cause real issue not getting solvenand real lessons not learnt. Thus taking opinions as knowlege, bigotry as awareness and living in a fantasy world detached from reality. End result is when that west is noticablly falling in behind in some areas, it comes in as shock to the populace and would offers no solutions for it other than denial of the fact.

[21:37:11] Comment: dyz564b by hamaon : Oh my god I just got it for the pharmacy and it is *terrible*. I heard things but I had no idea it micromanages down to 15 minute intervals! Managed to make a schedule that meets the metrics, isn't super terrible as far as coverage goes, and won't make half of my techs quit for better jobs at a hospital but it took two hours of tweaking everything just right with the "roles" and putting random 15 minute breaks in at inconvenient times and one person had to go down to one 4hr shift a week to keep everyone else's hours intact.

What's really puzzling about it is that it wants me to schedule when people are doing technician duties and when they are doing cashier duties, when our POMs and SOPs say to be as flexible with changing tasks throughout the day as possible. Do what needs to be done that minute. If someone is at the register go ring up their rx. If no one is at the register fill some scripts. I'm not really sweating that part because I don't imagine this can be enforced, I mean what would that look like? Well there's no one at the register and there's 60 in input but that's not my job today so I'm just gonna twiddle my thumbs?  posted to submission: When Customer First Scheduling kicks in...

[21:38:04] Comment: dyz5dps by im_not_here_ : Plenty cooks well in the Microwave. Steamed veg for example in the microwave (just in a container with a small amount of water from frozen) is always better than anything other than a dedicated steamer but a fraction of the time. 

I actually prefer the baked potatoes entirely microwaved now I am used to it. I add a little oil over them and turn a few times while cooking to keep it covered. It is not crispy, but it tastes 1000x better than crispy. 

Defrosting never works that well, it does technically work but causes issues and is not worth it unless you really screwed up for a meal and need to defrost quick.

How different is your indoor vs outdoor heart rate. I seem to have an insane difference between training inside and riding outside. I'm sure part of that is adrenaline, but seems like it must be more.

Other question: What do you consider resting heart rate? Mine is average for a trained individual on the low end at 60bpm, but it doesn't take much to spike that. Even moving around my arms a bit spikes it 10-20bpm easily. Are people just taking their lowest value when they've been sitting/laying for 5m, or do you tend to stick at that value unless you're up and walking, etc? posted to submission: What is your heart rate?

[21:39:01] Comment: dyz5dqk by Heerrnn : Alright fair enough, but we already have speeding up energy in the game. And one of mystic's main traits are energy manipulation. I don't see how this wouldn't go well with the game, it would allow for interesting plays. 

And I think you're reasoning wrong when you say it would make it more difficult to play the card, for example imagine getting the 65 (?) total energy from the entire game right at the beginning of the game instead of having to wait for it, it would make it much easier to play. This is the same but at a lower degree, you are essentially given the energy upfront. 

Plus, Pope's ability is highly dependant on being able to play him at the right moment, which is much easier to do the lower his energy cost is. 

I don't know, perhaps people on this sub are just extremely conservative or overly pessimistic, or this suggestion was a bit too complicated for people to get their head around. In my opinion it's a change that would allow a card with an interesting mechanic to be played more often, while not changing the energy cost in total.  posted to submission: Idea for Pope Timmy

But to any normal sort of human being, who has shared connections with their significant other, evidence is extremely useful in not being thrown under the bus and losing all your friends.

Some horrid person cheats on you, and because they're a horrid person, they are very likely to lie to all your shared friends and say you are to blame for the break-up, and that you're crazy and who knows what else. Guess you wouldn't want a binder full of evidence in that situation, eh? posted to submission: this is the level of petty i aspire to be.

How can Drake be bigger than Em if Em has already outsold him this decade, while being less relatable to younger crowds and having critically panned albums.  Also Drake wasnt the best selling artist of his generations while Em was the top selling artist of the 2000's.  I first heard of Em in pre K and Im finishing college and hes still releasing billboard 200 toppers.  I could get your argument if you said Drake made better music than Em, but saying he was a bigger artist than Em is just statistically innacurate. posted to submission: Daily Discussion Thread 05/14/2018

All I'm saying is government is corrupt. I'm sure some aren't, but the feeling I got was most are. From your local, county, state and feds. They just try to skate by without making to many waves. Nobody pursues things that aren't too corrupt.

Personally I say if you are a little worried: Don't use it when wet (you or the laptop), don't use it on a well-grounded surface (metal table tops, wet floors, etc) and don't use it in unpolarized outlets. If you are *really* worried don't use it while charging. You should be fine.  posted to submission: Ground prong broke off my laptop charger

[21:44:06] Comment: dyz5py2 by NaturesEternal : Pick out a cucumber when getting groceries. Fuck themselves with it and then eat it.

Also find out the foods and drinks they hate, and make them eat or drink that as punishment.

Clothespins on the nipples (pinches behind the nipple not directly on it.) and then jump up and down until they come off.

Put on and take off clothespins all around the nipples.

Hold quarter to the wall with her tongue.

Have her make me a list of everything she would be willing to do for me. “allow my Dom to penetrate me anally” or “allow my Dom to wake me up in the middle of the night to have sex.” for example.

I have a really nice set of dice made out of bone. I can make her throw dice that will specify how many days she will have to wait for the next orgasm.

Figging - carved piece of ginger thats then used as a butt plug. Buuuuuurns.

Rubbing a small amount of toothpaste on her asshole. Also burns.

Make her Write Degrading Things on her Body in sharpy or lipstick or something cute like "Sorry, Daddy".

Make her do positions on uncooked rice.

Write lines. 

I have a ton of these but I would say the best thing that I like to do is use an app on my phone and write down various ideas as they come to me. And I keep a very clean and organized list of punishments used and not used yet. Keeping it always fresh. Same things with tasks.

[21:44:20] Comment: dyz5pya by Waitits2015 : >I’m unable to accelerate, and eventually my steering wheel locks up. At that point my brake pedal locks up as well.

That's a side-effect of the engine stalling. Power steering pump runs off of a pulley attached to the engine and power brakes use engine vacuum. When the engine dies, both systems die as well. 

Has the Check Engine Light illuminated? If so, take it back to Advance and get it scanned. That'll point you in the right direction.

Given the mileage, my best guess is a failing fuel pump. Otherwise it could be any number of faulty sensors.  posted to submission: 2006 Nissan Sentra continually dies (stalls out?) while driving. Lights on dash come on, radio still works. Help!

[21:44:33] Comment: dyz5pym by Mushroomer : It carries the risk of implosion, leaving behind millions of customers accustomed to only paying $10/mo for all new release movies. Suddenly if theatres want to keep those customers, they're going to have to foot the bill.

It's just not a sustainable price point for the medium. I think a subscription model is absolutely a viable future for cinema, but $10/mo is impossibly low.  $20/mo - with the same restrictions around multiple showings & non-premium formats - might be more viable. posted to submission: 41% of MoviePass Subscribers Would Pay Over Double the Current Price to Keep the Service Alive

[21:45:28] Comment: dyz5w8k by 4percent4 : You honestly don't need that many. One throw should one shot packs, then it comes to bosses where it would be a nice dps boost IF and only IF you're using traps that have no cd but honestly bosses melt even on a 5L. (new ones are shit because 8 second cd so throwing speed means nothing) But keep in mind you only really get 10% on the tree so you need 20% to break even and then you need to get a dagger/sceptre with attack speed, crit, spell damage then you have multi which would be better than cast speed. 4 prop with craftable still not cheap.

Then you have jewelry where a damage mod from either essences or shaper/elder would be better. Then you have the amulet slot Crit, crit multi, then cast speed again not going to be cheap.

You lose out on a pair of gloves with life and other useful stats such as throwing an additional trap. Just alt spammed and crafted life is better than these gloves. (you're on the NE side of the tree GL getting a decent life pool) 

If you're running MoM you don't need the BM part because you'll have more than enough regen. If you want aura's You have tinkerskin +EB. 

Kalisa's Grace are amazing for high mana cost skills.
For leveling which since they're lowish there's still Doedre's Tenure which you can easily corrupt for CoH. Again still better.

To make these gloves NOT vendor trash you need to toss on 50-100 life, remove the reduced throwing speed and then they would be used. Still a good pair of shaper gloves would outclass these which is how it should be. If you wanted BIS gloves toss in throw two additional traps or you bi pass the trap cooldown or trap limit. Boom they're used on every trapper build. Currently they will be used by people who don't play trappers and are a noob trap like Atziri's promise and AoF users. posted to submission: Let's kick-off the Incursion teaser cycle with a new unique item!

[21:46:09] Comment: dyz5w9a by Kazrules : Let's break it down. 

Using Black Panther as an example, the first teaser came out in June, a mere eight months before the film's release. 

If you continue on with that marketing pattern, the first Captain Marvel would estimately come out of July this year. 

Usually teasers come out a week or two before it starts popping up in the movie theater. In order to Captain Marvel to play before AMATW, it would have to come out mid/late June, which would break the marketing pattern.

So, no, I don't think it'll play before Ant Man. But anything's possible.

My best guess is SDCC 2018 (July 19-22), which fits in perfectly with the marketing. It'll probably play before Disney's Christopher Robin. posted to submission: Captain Marvel trailer before Ant-Man and the Wasp?

I suppose the argument there would be that the work of Herodotos was written down (as far as we know) immediately, whereas the great epics existed as oral tradition for centuries after their final composition and were (again as far as we know) not written down by their original authors. I would also argue that there's a difference between poetry commemorating the deeds of heroes and Herodotos *outright stating* that his work serves the purpose of doing so. Even if this is only a difference of genre convention, that already suffices to prove my point. posted to submission: Who were ancient historians like Thucydides and Josephus writing for?

[21:46:27] Comment: dyz5w9q by blueyelie : I'm a bit of dummy for Credit Card stuff but I'm going to try and explain the situation and what I need help with.

Currently have 1 credit card (Chase Slate) with 9.99% APR with a $7,183.82 balance to pay on it. My minimum payment is 130; I've been doing about 150, usually showing about $65 interest.

I'm looking to potentially transfer a balance to this [Ally Credit Card](https://www.ally.com/credit-cards/cash-back-credit-card/). I have a savings with them (1.60%), they have been really cool, and more or less I wouldn't even use the card except for the transfer. It has decent rewards post-paying off stuff.

My questions is - if I transfer a balance off the Slate card (say 1000 bucks) and pay it off fine in the first 12 months billing cylce of the Ally card. Will pulling that money off the Slate LOWER the bill on the credit card? 

I know I could keep putting 150 each month to Slate but if I could make that 150 take more (the interest really digging in) it would be ideal. 

I have NEVER done a balance transfer before and just very wary about it. But I really want to get this debt down and have that credit card for emergency only. I was stupid and young - that's why it got up there so far.

[21:47:10] Comment: dyz5wal by Apastrix : Wrong about how you see the world and how you think about it and how you feel about it, wrong in your judgment and in your reasoning about it. We live and we die without knowing much if anything, we are too limited, how can we be so sure about what we want if we don't know what's happening around us? What is this life? Why does it exist? What are we supposed to do? Why would we do anything? Why should we choose existence over oblivion?

Hell who knows, maybe Elsie is a successful host and the red ball is her. Or maybe Elsie is just a figment of Barnard's "imagination" and he has the rifle in his hand the whole time. Maybe Elsie is to Bernard what Arnold was to Dolores at this point. They worked closely together, Elsie preferred hosts over people and Bernard might have actually kill her which might have caused some internal conflict for Bernard.

If you're suggesting that it's purely cbmm within your glory rank them sure, I could maybe agree, but you'd have a lot of bad players who are upset that they're getting stomped by better players.

[21:48:43] Comment: dyz62dc by id-entity : The fragmentary style of Wittgenstein (which is not his only style) is reminiscent of Heracleitos and other presocratics, as they wrote/were preserved. In this sense of return to poetry W is kin to Heidegger.

And this is what got me interested in Badiou, his fierce criticism of W's "antiphilosophy" and/or prephilosophy. Curious to hear Badiou's case for *philosophy*, as he defines it, which seems to remain inherently colonialist project, and if the inherent colonialism of philosophy is worth it, somehow. So far, at the beginning, it sounds like Badiou's tactic towards Heidegger and his followers is the classic "embrace to death", and I actually hope that Badiou can deliver what he promises in that front. Judging from the reviews, at least on the surface Badiou's rhetorical arsenal in his battle with Wittgenstein is much poorer, character assassination and denial that middle and late Wittgenstein exist at all.  posted to submission: The Enduring Brilliance of Ludwig Wittgenstein

[21:49:19] Comment: dyz62e1 by k8207dz : For those wondering if there will be another Superhot VR game...

Callum Underwood, the ex-Oculus producer who was instrumental in getting *Superhot VR* made, has mentioned a few times that he's working on a new VR game, like in [this talk](https://www.slideshare.net/CallumUnderwood1/why-are-publishers-not-betting-on-vr-89913574) from a few months ago.

Coincidentally, if you look at [his bio](https://www.twitter.com/DevRelCallum) he is now working directly with Team Superhot on "Special Projects".

So it seems very likely that Team Superhot is making another VR game, it's just a matter of when. I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being a launch title for Santa Cruz next year. posted to submission: Superhot sequel announced.

[21:49:20] Comment: dyz62e3 by Lycanthrowrug : I have another, too. I was at a pool in West Hollywood with friends, and one of them was wearing some kind of metal cock ring -- which fell off while he was swimming -- so we were trying to find it on the bottom of the pool. Now, you know how young boys can be when they see an opportunity to help, so some very enthusiastic ~13 year old kid with goggles swam up and said, "What are you looking for?" We said, "Ummm, a metal ring." So the kid dives down and comes back up with it in his hand, hands it to the owner. 

Pretty sure the kid had no idea he'd retrieved a guy's cock ring from the bottom of the swimming pool.... posted to submission: Confused by gay culture stories?

[21:49:24] Comment: dyz62e7 by mistah_legend : You're missing the point. I was under the impression that Humble had more verses because it so much more complex than This is America. 

There is a problem with the fact that the lyrics are lacking with This is America. It's a simple message which is great, but the musical execution could've been done better by Glover. 

The video is a masterpiece which is why people are really talking about it. 

Without the video it's another song talking about violence in America. 

Thoughts and Prayers by grandson is more complex than This is America. Same general message. If grandson had the same video production as Glover, im sure his song would've blown up too.  posted to submission: The E stands for Emancipation

[21:49:39] Comment: dyz679m by sovereign007 : Something you need to keep in mind is that no single number is going to give you the answer you need, because the number by itself varies with application. Some benchmarks and games show a small variation from desktop performance, others show larger ones.

It also heavily depends on the GPU in question and the resolution you plan to be running. It also depends on the framerate being rendered.

In other words, it is hard to give a single value.

That said, the 60% number is false, as the average seems to be better than 60% over TB2 (more around 75-85%).

The best information will come from asking people with the same system about the performance they are getting.

[21:49:58] Comment: dyz67a5 by Gayest_Charr_Ever : You... seem to misunderstand. I'm saying that ranged and melee should have the same unbuffed DPS when ranged is standing at ranged and when melee is standing in melee. Ranged should have significantly less DPS unbuffed than melee unbuffed if it gets closer than about 700 range to its target. Melee in this situation is still optimal over ranged because melee can receive group buffs which then makes it do twice as much damage as the ranged. posted to submission: What's your GW2 unpopular opinion?

[21:52:24] Comment: dyz67br by blaaaaa : It has tons of options and viable strategies which you liked about Tiny Epic Galaxies, but those can often be limited by the cards you draw (often you draw card that is worthless at that state in the game).  I wouldn't consider the game  too random as you have a lot of options to deal with the randomness of card draws.  I love the theme, it works best of you're kind of a science nerd.  Like if the idea of  introducing insects to a Martian exosystem excites you, than you'll enjoy it. As far as complexity I would read through the rulebook  to check that your group could handle it since it is a step up from the games you listed.  The game is also longer than most of the games you listed.  Component quality is a common complaint, but the only thing that bugs me is the incosistant card art.  Some cards use photographs, some more cartoony, etc.  If you group is prone to bumping into the table, the player boards will likely be a problem as that will knock the production markers off. posted to submission: /r/boardgames Daily Discussion and Game Recommendations (May 14, 2018)

[21:52:48] Comment: dyz6ety by TimDamnit : A good solo is a composition, albeit an improvised one.  It has an idea, development, embellishment, tension, and resolution, just as a good composition does.  This is why Sonny Rollins's solos (for an example) sound so much better than a series of scales or arpeggios.  

This realization helped me develop solos, at least.  Try writing out some, not to perform, but to see what ideas you can develop.  Take a piece or set of changes, write a motif, and continue developing it over a chorus.  Then try to apply the ideas and approach to improvising.   posted to submission: Problems with Learning to Improvise

Anyway Deckard decides that the blame would all go to me. Didn't say anything all game until it was clear that we lost and then just a barrage of  "Useless fucking Anub didn't do anything all game" and Artanis piped in that it was a 4v5. I was in every teamfight, I webbed Valla every time. I peeled and stunned and weaved in and out as much as possible to stay in a fight with basically no heals.

The second point makes sense but most so-cons aren't encouraged to speak up by the party. During Harper's majority, ssm wasn't repealed, abortion wasn't banned and the death penalty wasn't implemented. All hell would break loose if Canada went backwards on all this (except maybe the death penalty) and I'm sure most Conservatives know this. The Conservatives even switched to a neutral definition of marriage in their policy book because of this.

Before we really started looking, I made a comment at work like "this thing is going to cost me $10K" (in a tone suggesting I thought that was a unreasonably high number).  A girl who sat next to me said "maybe 20 years ago" (in a tone suggesting I was in for quite a rude awakening). For whatever reason, that made me think "I will get this done for under $10K".

For instance, place a vertical mirror in front of you, twisted 45^(o) to the right. Place an object over to the right side of the room so you can see it in the mirror.  Now you look straight ahead and you see a virtual image of the object that seems to be in front of you.  You don't have to look to the right to see it.

Several dictionaries define shiksa as a disparaging and offensive term applied to a non-Jewish girl or woman.[4][5] In 2014, Rabbi Jack Abramowitz described it as "simply indefensible", "inherently condescending, racist and misogynistic".[6]

Another issue is his total unfamiliarity with the topic leading him to be completely unaware of alternatives. 

I just wrote a more detailed response elsewhere but essentially :

Study overseas in a country that values educated citizens 

Save and pay cash for education,study as a mature student 

Study in stages (1 year,  diploma, work, another year,cert, work, 1 year bsc...)

Seek a charitable sponsor 

Seek an industrial/government sponsor (increasingly common and a wonderful solution)  posted to submission: Martin Lewis destroys politicians over student finance scaremongering (BBC QT)

[21:56:38] Comment: dyz6lnj by rabid_briefcase : They're better because when the wind is coming off the sea the air is more steady.

Inland wind is highly turbulent and is often variable with gusts. The wind is going around trees, hills, buildings, and other barriers that both funnel (speed up) and block the wind. Wind may gust and shift 10 or 20 knots from minute to minute. Wind will change significantly with altitude.

Wind off a large body of water doesn't have any of those obstructions. It tends to be steady from minute to minute, and to gradually increase with altitude.


If you don't have bodies of water nearby, look for areas with large flat fields, areas that are at the top of hills rather than the bottom of bowls/depressions.  Also, look at wind sites (like WindFinder.com) and the hour-by-hour local point forecast (such as those from forecast.weather.gov) to help pinpoint good kite weather. posted to submission: Quick question... will a big kite suffer if you trim it’s stock tails?

[21:56:41] Comment: dyz6lnm by FeelsBadManx : No worries, burst most is never really preferred (i will use the vector in burst until i get an extended clip sometimes) Most good players will keep their gun in auto for just about everything. Which can be tough at the beginning for medium fights.


So my suggestion is to get used to changing fire mode often based on the situation until you can single tap (replicate semi-auto, one bullet per click) in full auto reliably.  For example, say we are playing in Miramar, and I know someone is in a complex, I would have my gun on single until I’m about 50-100m out, then switch to full auto. Another thing to keep in mind is what situation you might be in, I find that keeping in full auto at all times is best as it’s more likely that I die to someone sneaking up on me as opposed to someone 200 meters out where I might be in single fire. We have all be in a situation where we think we are in full auto, shoot one bullet and proceed to do the full auto pull down, and die because of one bullet doesn’t kill people very well :)

2. Get someone to drive you at 15mph \(or slower\) through residential neighborhoods, downtown areas, shopping center parking lots, and apartment complexes.  Failing that, walk in a populated area.  Don't stick to a park unless it's littered with lured pokestops \- you'll overfish the area and miss out on spawns.  It's better to keep walking around a downtown area to maximize the spawns you'll encounter rather than sticking to a sparsely lured park.
3. Unless charmander's catch rate is greatly improved, only use great and ultra balls to catch.  I'd use great \+ razz or ultra \+ pinap for most you see.  Definitely break out the ultra \+ golden or ultra \+ razz for any shinies you see. posted to submission: What's best way to spend community day?

But if the expensive car does not really affect your net worth (your net worth is HUGE), you might as well buy a flashy expensive race car, and have fun. It is an expression of exuberant wealth. Does not go together with a 70k/year lifestyle, more like 10X that. It would also be cool just to be able to say you "could" buy a lambo, by having the BTC equivalent in your wallet. It does not mean you should buy the car. By all means, its a useless car, has poor gas mileage, terrible ground clearance, bad visibility, limited trunk space, no back seat for banging chicks, etc... But it is a symbol of wealth. Many people care about symbols.  posted to submission: Lambos are coming

[21:58:52] Comment: dyz6s7a by mcapello : I think the Weiss article was the nail in the coffin for this "movement", which otherwise had some promising aspects.

Portraying yourself as a censorship victim (or having Bari Weiss portray you that way) while appearing in the New York Times and other mainstream venues, speaking at sold-out public engagements, earning tens of thousands online, publishing best-selling books through Amazon... well, it's not very credible. And it's downright embarrassing and hypocritical when you're on that part of the political spectrum that is tirelessly lecturing other people about how they shouldn't identify as victims. And yet these people have, and for some of the weakest reasons anyone could ever imagine. It's kind of pathetic.

And yet some of their ideas are genuinely interesting and worthy of study and reasonable discussion. Unfortunately, by miring themselves in the culture war and playing the victim card for publicity, they've almost guaranteed that those ideas will be used as little more than cannon fodder and ideological talking points, both for and against.  posted to submission: Intellectual Dark Web Megathread

[21:59:08] Comment: dyz6s7i by Gamaxray : I can relate to the frustration of the stigma and control of medication.  I am on opioid maintenance. The friend I referred to earlier decided to try life without medication and ended up self medicating with ineffective and possibly dangerous substances. Then when he wanted to return to the previous medication regiment the doctors thought he was seeking drugs and did not resume medication assisted therapy. It was very difficult to watch happen. And it's something I have seen repeatedly to different extents. My friend is probably the only person I have known to truly have ADHD. Most others are unfortunate victims of over diagnosis or people seeking stimulants. Goofing of in class is it in a nut shell.  I'm pretty sure you know what I am getting at. But if you want to provide info about diagnosis do it. It's info the needs to be known. And you definitely are more invested and knowledgeable on this subject them me. I mean you live with it.

[21:59:16] Comment: dyz6s7v by Occams_Flathead : A girl I quickly befriended in college seemed pretty cool at first glance.  But I quickly learned she had huge attention seeking problems.  I took her to a party where she was all over me at the party, arm in arm, holding my hand everywhere we went, I wasn't allowed to be alone.  When I did start talking to another pair at the party, a couple at that, she kicked it up a notch, trying to kiss/cuddle and what not.  I was fine with it at the time because; hey, she sees nice, she's cute, a little intense, but could be misreading it.  After the party I walked her back to the dorm and she very informatively told me not to try anything because she had a boyfriend.

Bonus.  Same girl a few weeks later told me that if I had really wanted to sleep with her I shouldn't have told her I was straight because she can't help but "turn" men. posted to submission: Men of reddit, what are some tell-tale signs that a woman is creepy?

[21:59:34] Comment: dyz6s86 by Readwit : Hey, 

Sounds like it'll be a fun campaign - lots you can do with that era. 

Now normally I'd say to either use Soldier for this or else a Soldier/Scoundrel mutliclass, but looking at the composition of your group I think it should be fine. 

The reason I say that is that you Warden will probably go into Martial Arts, and the other two are 3/4 BaB classes like you are. 

While playing as a Soldier would get you a slightly higher attack bonus, it'll only be two more than what you'll have as a Scoundrel before multiclassing. There are abilities that can offset this as you say - you'll still be playing 'catch up' as the same or similar abilities may be taken by a Soldier but again I doubt the Soldier in your group will be focussing on conventional ranged combat. 

Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols (a solid choice for any Gunslinger) gives you +1 when using pistols. Pretty decent but not very flashy. 
You actually need Point Blank Shot to qualify for Gunslinger - that's another +1 but it is situational and so doesn't always apply. 
Skirmisher is alright - it's best paired with Running Attack (and Rebellion Military Training). Improved Skirmisher and Sneak Attack can provide a good damage boost but can be rather Talent heavy. 

Are you using point buy (because you should be!)? 
I'd expect the 'average' Scoundrel to have quite a large range across their abilities (10s and 16s) Have you decided on a Species yet? You could choose one with a DEX bonus suc as a Rodian or Gungan which would allow a DEX  as high as 18 without it being too point intensive. 
Now I tend to expect soldiers to have more of an even mix of 12s and 14s, so your 16 or 18 DEX would actually eliminate the BaB disparity in one go. 

So in short: While this might be more efficient as a Soldier, it's perfectly possible to build a Gunslinger based on Scoundrel.  posted to submission: Scoundrel Gunslinger - how viable is it?

[21:59:45] Comment: dyz6s8j by OffendedLiverSausage : *Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think* von Rosling, Rosling und Rönnlund. 

Es ist ein Sachbuch, aber wirklich sehr gut lesbar (habs im Zug gelesen). Ich übertreibe nicht, wenn ich sage: Das Buch hat meine Weltsicht umgekrempelt. 

Ich weis nicht wie das bei dir ist, aber ich verzweifele manchmal an unserer Welt. Überall brennt es scheinbar und nichts geht voran. *Factfulness* ist dabei ein wichtiger reality check. Das Buch behauptet nicht, alles ist gut. Aber es rückte zumindest mein Weltbild von hoffnungslos zu es geht voran, und wenn wir jetzt mit anpacken sogar noch schneller.

Jenseits des Inhalts ist das Buch allein schon deshalb lesbar weil es rhetorisch und didaktisch brilliant ist. Ich habe Statistik noch nie so plastisch dargestellt erlebt. Narration, Zahlen, und Diagramme fügen sich nahtlos ineinander.

[21:59:48] Comment: dyz6s8k by hungry_dugong : I posted a while ago under a throw-away about some marital problems I was having and I wanted an outside perspective. The overwhelming response was that she was cheating on me and I should kick her out. 

Several months later, after communicating more and some therapy it would appear that I was primed to suspect cheating after a failed prior marriage, my wife had hid some of her actions from me, and it looked bad because I discovered the concealment and but didnt see the actions. My wife didnt realise that her actions only made her look guilty in my eyes. The actions themselves were relatively innocent but she'd *thought* I'd be upset and she hadn't wanted the hassle.

Had I followed the ground swell of opinion my marriage would be over.  Although a logical argument should outweigh the tide of popular opinion, I'm afraid it doesn't always work out that way.

I've got full coverage over NA, SA and Asia, the aliens have one base in South Africa but are on the brink of toppling the other two African countries. I think I'm holding my own in the air game, and most ground missions are a patient but steady breeze to get through. 

I've taken on every single mission so far, except Deluge - it popped at the wrong time, after a hectic week when I just couldn't muster the non-fatigued manpower for it. I pushed for MECs and gene mods early, so my psionics is in the early days. Eight brave soldiers have died so far attempting to hold back the alien menace, but several walking wounded volunteered for augmentation to take up the slack. 

It's the 31st October now, and although Heavy Floaters, Bezerkers, Mectoids and random pods of Outsiders are now a regular occurrence, the best of the best from my Barracks have touched down in the alien stronghold to take the fight back to them.

I'm at least waiting until after game 3 to abandon ship, but I'm almost out of optimism at this point. *Almost.*

That said, home ice matters less than just about any other home advantage in pro sports. Caps are good on the road, but so are the Bolts.

They know their season's on the line tomorrow night, they have to realize it. Can they win 4 out of 5 against this team? I'm not sure, but they won 4 straight to close out Boston. I don't think they're going to get swept out, at least.

Nothing to do but hope they go out and do the damn thing tomorrow night and make this a series.

[22:02:37] Comment: dyz6wxm by lilyofjudah : I would look at a variety of templates and consider all possible needs. We had to update mine several times over the years to basically allow me to sign anything (always after consulting with the parents, if possible, but if necessary of course to use my own judgement) including not just emergency medical situations but things like the following:

School field trip permission slips

Permission to attend medical AND psychiatric appointments (the latter has to be specified if necessary), receive advice from the doctor, receive and fill prescriptions

Consent for medical treatment

Release of information for the school, doctors, both medical and psych

I will try to remember to pull mine out later and see what I am forgetting as it has become pretty comprehensive and has been tested in a variety of situations! We had ridiculous situations where I could call the advice nurse and explain all the symptoms, but she was not allowed to give me the advice (she could, however, call the home phone number for the child and leave a message which I could then listen to....

I also moved to the USA not long ago, and not having many people to talk to can be pretty hard on you, especially when you're going through other stress in your life besides the move.

Finding someone you trust and can talk to so openly is hard, and you might not want to confide on people you just met, without fearing that they will judge you, etc.

A therapist can hear you out and talk about your personal issues without being associated with your new work, friends, etc. so you don't feel like you sharing with them will affect your life outside of their office. posted to submission: This girl from I went to high school with just shared this

[22:04:42] Comment: dyz75eh by PostGirls : Looks like a lot of work went into your response! 

Unfortunately, I can only give one or two sentences at a time at work between conference calls and work that requires me to be in flow-state and block out distractions. 

However to your points: 

1. I don't mind if it's inadequately answered for your purposes. Of course they would wish to live among white people, and of course there's nothing (officially) prohibiting it at the moment. You referenced wealth, which is a filter that is very useful. There are, indeed, two black families in the neighborhood at the moment, and both are Thomas Sowell-esque conservative families with grown children or children on the verge of college.

However, regression to the mean will result in those children likely not achieving the lofty intellectual heights of their parents. Particularly since 3 of those four parents are very intelligent, and one is perhaps of slightly above average intelligence (adjusting for group.) 

[Additionally, you were careful to state that the preference to live among a different ethnic group exists, but never to say that it is the majority. And you were right to be careful, because it is an outlier in the overall trend of people wishing to live among their own kind.](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/12/02/americans-say-they-like-diverse-communities-election-census-trends-suggest-otherwise/)

As for intermarriage, it is a Voldemort view (the view that exists but cannot be expressed) to say that 'no, I oppose interracial marriage.' Even though most people have a natural aversion to doing so, and must have it reinforced from K-12 and on to higher education such falsehoods like "diversity is our strength" and that "race is only skin deep." The older wisdom, and the truth that the statistics bear out, is that race is a complex series of genetic similarities that code for specific appearance and behavior. While most white people aren't going to say "no, it grosses me out" to the person on the phone, or the brown girl with the clipboard as they try to walk down Delmar, after a few drinks you can usually prize the the truth out of them. 

And regardless, when asked in the hypothetical sense, they're not picturing themselves, they're picturing an abstract idea of intermarriage. But when it's for themselves, their families, their daughters, the answer is 'no.' And you can see them living that answer in the very study you referenced. 

With regard to Chinatown -- the Chinese have a stronger in-group preference than whites. In fact, all other ethnic groups have a stronger in-group preference and a less developed sense of altruism (though ours is in the process of destroying what we've built.) If you were to attempt to try to rent an apartment in Chinatown, you would be met with obstacles. Landlords who do not speak English, a rate that's offered to you much higher than equivalent lodgings elsewhere, the cold disinterest of a population who doesn't share your culture or heritage, and ultimately you'd probably give up. 

Certainly, sometimes, it would be possible to rent a space. But the reason it exists is because the Chinese do not go out of their way to attract other ethnic groups to their enclaves. In addition, as a white man, if you felt you were being discriminated against, there would be effectively no recourse for you to pursue. No one would take such an instance seriously. 

Pittsburgh is actually very nice, and considering how similar it is to St. Louis, it may one day be a case study for what I'm talking about. Though in truth, I just threw it out because I was there and the city's character impressed me. Portland (Maine or Oregon) are stronger examples, but you'll notice it scales with having a white super-majority. 

As for interracial marriages, that source doesn't state where the growth occurred, and again, includes Hispanics as white. 

The topic of race and crime is less complex from the point of view that white communities are safer than black ones, therefore, I'd prefer to live in a white one. New York City is an extreme example of a multicultural hell hole which I must visit occasionally, though I wouldn't call their "record low" crime rates anything to write home about. The amount of racial profiling (stop and frisk) that it took to make that happen was not popular regardless of how effective. That city couldn't be considered to be "co-existing" as much as "at an uneasy ceasefire." Though blacks there are more relaxed about race than St. Louis blacks, certainly. 

Regardless, it's not an environment that promotes mental health. By any reasonable standard, the median person in the Western world is more socially atomized, or an individual not attached to an identifiable group, or groups, in the larger society, than at any time in recorded history. NYC particularly so. 

In any case, you have not given sufficient reason for WHY whites must be forced into unwanted diversity and multiculturalism, only said that it is a thing that happens. When black people account for most of the arrests for murder (51.3%), robbery (55.9%) and gambling (58.9%). And are also significantly above the average in several other categories: weapons crimes (40.7%), prostitution and commercialised vice (41.8%) and aggravated assault (33.1%)... 

What's the incentive to be nearer to that?  posted to submission: Home for Mother's Day: St. Louis activists bail out African-American moms who can’t afford the fees

[22:05:23] Comment: dyz75f2 by WikiTextBot : **Edge case**

An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter. For example, a stereo speaker might noticeably distort audio when played at maximum volume, even in the absence of any other extreme setting or condition.

An edge case can be expected or unexpected. In engineering, the process of planning for and gracefully addressing edge cases can be a significant task, and yet this task may be overlooked or underestimated.

[22:05:46] Comment: dyz75fe by lcnielsen : > Of course! I'm thinking mainly about modern day Israel in terms of my answer, because that's what the questions are about. In that regard, the historical record shows that from the earliest settlement of Jerusalem, it was a Jewish area, albeit with other competing tribes. Texts such as the Amarna letters and Dead Sea scrolls, as well as mikvehs and other structures support this historical understanding. Thus I look at it as "occupied"in the sense that the original Jewish population was either subjugated or expelled through the long view of history. Additionally, that's why I consider the land of Israel/the mandate as one region.

Jericho is right in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and it was populated way, way, WAY before there were anything like Jews anywhere in the world, though :P

But yeah, definitely a topic where it is nowhere near possible to make everybody happy. Personally I consider claims of continuity between the ancient kingdoms of Israel or Judea and the modern state of Israel about... well, a good deal more absurd as the Pahlavi dynasty's claim to continuity between the Achaemenid Empire and the modern state of Iran, which is a pretty absurd claim in its own right. But that's besides the point! posted to submission: What were the Arab countries planning to do should they have won the 1948 war with Israel?

[22:08:03] Comment: dyz7c20 by Villager_01 : No sé si sea tanto eso. El gobierno en su momento pudo haber juntado a las familias más poderosas del país y tratar de darles un incentivo para que tuvieran interés en invertir en innovación tecnológica e investigación científica, de ahí el gobierno se iba a ver forzado en aumentar la educación, una mejor educación hubiese creado instituciones más limpias, con instituciones más limpias generaban una gran comunicación con los más vulnerables lo que les iba a dar mejor calidad de vida a éstos mismos; si generas todo eso alejas a la gente de malos paso. Todo esto iba a dar un aumento a la calidad de vida en el país.

Tal vez suene como un sueño, pero un sueño que se pudo haber hecho realidad.

En Corea el gobierno le dio todo, literalmente todo, a sus empresas, a cambio les exigió que crecieran en innovación, las empresas se vieron obligadas a exigir buena mano de obra, por lo que el gobierno impulsó demasiado su educación y así fue como crecieron, empezaron de arriba hacía abajo. Lo malo: una educación que suprime demasiado la vida de niños y jóvenes (probablemente más de 14 horas al día estudiando), la mayor aspiración de los jóvenes es llegar a trabajar en las grandes empresas en lugar de buscar emprendimiento, nepotismo desmedido y demasiada presión social. posted to submission: ¿Es la guerra contra el narco el peor acontecimiento qué le ha pasado a México en los últimos 25 años?

[22:08:07] Comment: dyz7c24 by mooshkagirl : So, I'm the 27F on the other end of this...not literally, but I'm the 29F going through the exact same thing with my 34M quasi ex.  Same length of relationship, same reason for "going on a break," same feelings he shared with me of feeling "trapped" by me asking when he could commit in the face of him refusing to move in officially or get engaged.

He's been struggling with this in all of his adult relationships.  I'm his third serious adult girlfriend....like, each relationship 2+ years.  We basically lived together.  I joined his faith.  I was close to his family.  Etc.  Where things finally broke for him was when his therapist told him...."You don't even have uncertainty, because that would mean you had questions about the relationship or about yourself to answer and then, once you answered them, you could find clarity.  You just have vagueness.  You're not asking anything.  You're just stuck and paralyzed by an abstract fear of commitment."  

I wonder if you're in the same position.  Are you possibly seeking any therapy or life coaching?  Do you have any specific reasons why you don't feel safe about committing?  I think some people are a little overly-romantic when they say you'll be able to commit when you find "the one."  Maybe I'm not my guy's "one," but he cannot articulate any make-or-break type issues between us, and it seems to be a broader issue for him with all intimate partner relationships.

Maybe it would help you to do some work to try and figure out what the questions you have about her and about commitment are, and then when you can answer them, you might realize you do really want to be with her.....or maybe she's the wrong fit for XYZ reason...or maybe you just don't like the level of commitment that comes with moving in or getting engaged and never will. 

But right now, I'm not sure you're asking the specific questions. posted to submission: I [27M] dumped my girlfriend [27F] of almost three years yesterday because I could never “take the next step.” Why can’t I commit?

[22:08:15] Comment: dyz7c2a by dolan313 : It is regional, there's so called *Verkehrsverbunde*, I'd translate as transportation federations, there's one for almost every Federal State except Vienna, Lower Austria, and Burgenland. The latter three share a common Verkehrsverbund, the Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region (VOR). East Region. Within each of these Verbunde, you can generally buy some sort of yearly pass or discount card. For example as a student, I pay 60€ for the VOR youth ticket annually, which grants me access to practically all public transport in those three states, except some privately-operated trains. So in that sense it's amazing for me in terms of price. For adults I'm not quite sure, I know you can buy a season ticket on a certain route within the VOR which costs 365€ per year, so you can use any public transport on that route you want, train, bus, metro tram. This is ideal for people who commute from Lower Austria to Vienna.

The individual cities are more complicated. I can only talk about Vienna. Vienna's public transport is run by the *Wiener Linien*, or Vienna Lines. This includes buses, trams, metro. All of these lines are part of VOR, so if you're like me and have a youth season ticket, it's all free, and commuters like the ones mentioned earlier can use these lines to connect from regional trains into the city.

In Vienna itself the 365€ annual ticket, instead of a certain route, (if I recall correctly), grants you access to all Wiener Linien lines. Of course if you work outside of Vienna in Lower Austria you can also buy an annual ticket for that route.

Hope this wasn't too confusing. posted to submission: Does your country have an integrated public transport system?

Not when it comes to religion. Hard to take anyone serious when there are such stark contrasts between the parties.

Below are obvious ways that theocracy is in the GOP platform.

The banning of Muslim immigrants into the US.

Trump issued an executive order that removed religious protections for those who get government subsidized social services.

The GOPs stance on moving money from the public school system to Christian charter schools.

The GOPs anti LGBT and anti abortion stances are grounded in the Christian religion.

I'm not saying you're wrong just doing some changes to make it better in my opinion.
-

I think you did good except  for the following.

Too much comparing to real life.Somethings are just game mechanics and are not intentional (ex:bullet caliber,360degrees,soda and pill etc).

Also.I think your theory is good but some details i think make this better and more logical :
-
* The Goverment is either Russia or USSR both because of the box and a comment that say ..."1993 is after the fall of the Soviet Union. "... and i confirmed and it's wrong but not far off.And also, who has the fame of making super weapons and super soldier (other than Hitler)?The USSR!And all of that mystery thing.My best guess is USSR making GMO humans, putting them to fight, picking the best, grouping them and take over those capitalist pigs (jk).
* I think they are 100% humans and no nanobots are in the case.That was a little innacuracy of yours.But i completely agree they are GMO humans.
* They propably aren't called Survivrs.
* The radiation thing might be another weapon being put to use.
* Your comparation of appearence from the survivrs and the lab subject is another bad move.Is like saying "That is Usain Bolt.You look like Usain Bolt.You're Usain Bolt too!Wow!".
* You said "Being able to hold equal amounts of 7.62mm and 5.56mm, even though 5.56mm is much lighter." but it's not about weigh but it's about size.
* Also, they are with weapons (very heavy), that would make then even more stronger and faster (they run very fast with lots of weigh(in this situation i'm flawing my first argument)). posted to submission: Off-topic hypothesis: Who, or what, are the survivrs?

I’m a civil servant so the path to getting promoted or hopping to a better job in a different department isn’t very clear.

Lived in 3 states here in the US, traveled to other nations (and not just Canada!) I WOULD like to see more of the world, but that also takes saving money. The picture of success I had in my head as a kid is the life I’m living right now. So why don’t I feel more lucky or more happy? 

I take on every extra assignment at work that I can, I can buy anything I would reasonably want. It’d be nice to live in a bigger city but I can keep up with the cost of living where I am now. 

Most nights I spend consoling my girlfriend. She has a very specific idea of success (“I want THIS job in THIS city”) and I think it’s hitting her that life isn’t as clear-cut or simple as it seemed back when she made these plans.

I dunno. I did everything right. Even spent two years in service to my country (national service not military service. Maybe some of you in the US know AmeriCorps. I’m proud to be a two-term alum.) making below minimum wage and not even minding it. I just feel like I’m not getting the rewards. I’m feeling like there’s not much reward to be had. 

Honestly I felt the MOST fulfilled in university/grad school. I was working toward a goal that was clearly-defined all the time. I was around people who were passionate and energetic. And now it’s just…more of the same each day.

[22:10:17] Comment: dyz7hav by pokerbrowni : I'm a little torn as to whether or not this is sincere, but I'll treat it as though it is.

It sounds to me like your wife is and extreme reaction to a combination of your daughter's behavior, and her exasperation with your enabling of it.  It also sounds like your daughter has you wrapped around her finger.  Also, most of what you've described isn't "abuse" by any reasonable definition; and using that term inappropriately to generate animosity towards your wife isn't helpful. And generating animosity towards her, and sympathy/kudos for yourself is the only reason I can see for you describing it that way.  The behavior you've described certainly isn't "good", and it's probably not the best way to deal with the situation, but it's not "abuse".

I'll also say, "avoiding anxiety" is NOT the way to deal with OCD.  Any competent doctor is going to have a treatment plan that will include deliberate exposure to stressors in an attempt to over-come the obsessive/compulsive impulses.  So if you think you are helping by just accommodating her every obsession, you are wrong.

Finally, you need to understand that the relationship between mother and daughter and father and daughter are VERY different.  Plus, it's not hard for two parents to see the same behaviors from one kid and legitimately come up with two different interpretations for the reasons.

What you should do is make sure you are all going to your daughter's therapy sessions (at least portions of them, where treatment is discussed).  That way you can all explain your views and get a third party's opinion on which aspects of how you all feel tend to be the reality. posted to submission: My [40M] wife [41F] is extremely unhelpful around our daughter's [16F] condition. This was probably the last straw for our marriage. Why does she act like this?

[22:10:37] Comment: dyz7hb5 by AzorackSkywalker : I think the main issue here is that Thanos is tainted by what happened on Titan. Even if he understands the logic, the emotion tied with his failure to save his people coupled with the fact that he can blame it on not listening to his initial, albeit idiotic plan, make him stick to his original thoughts. The mind can overwrite basic mathematical ability based on tribalism and emotion, which has to do with party politics and why one side often just can’t communicate with the same facts as another. Thanos has a large number of psychological issues that are usually easily identified, but the power and surety to an almost godly level with which the character has been portrayed conceals that nature to a degree. You see his weaknesses at some points, but overall it is hard to think of Thanos as anything but an all powerful villain most of the time posted to submission: Thanos doesn't understand basic math

[22:11:04] Comment: dyz7hbc by theDaninDanger : This date time format is Javascript ISO time notation for UTC time. \(see: [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js\_date\_formats.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_formats.asp)\) 

ISO Date Time format separates the date from the time portion with a "T" and signifies UTC \(a.k.a. GMT\) with a "Z" at the end.

So all you need to do is use strptime and define the format of your input accordingly. This will create a posix format object. 

Seems like RFiddle is gone, so I a put a small example on my site: [http://puttingthedanindanger.com/?q=content/r\-fiddle\-testing\-page\-1](http://puttingthedanindanger.com/?q=content/r-fiddle-testing-page-1) just click "Run" and it will open the console.

By the way, let me know if that works, I'm interested to see how well that functions.

If it doesn't work the code is:

`# Setting timestamp`

`timestampISO = "2018-01-17T10:17:34Z"`

`timestampR = strptime(timestampISO,format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")`

`print(timestampR)`

`#Now in POSIX format, able to access date objects`

`class(timestampR)`

`timestampR$mday`

`#add 1900 to get proper year`

`timestampR$year`

`timestampR$year + 1900` posted to submission: help with JSON time formatting in R: convert to time
[22:11:06] Comment: dyz7hbe by masterd794 : As others have said pay, and shifts vary a lot. For me, getting into the field I  landed a job at 19 and was a button pusher in a small shop making high production car parts, things for Ford, Pontiac, Cummings ect. Older guys didnt have a lot of time to teach much of anything so I spent a lot of time looking over the shoulders and asking about what I saw. 4 years later they finally trusted me enought to let me attempt switching over a setup. Started at $9/hr in 2008 and left in there in 2014 at $17.25. While that job was cool and I  learned a lot I much prefer the job i have now, i work in a smaller fab shop, and I do all of their machining on a small manual lathe and mill. I make more and its not the same monotonous thing day in and day out. While I definitely recommend at least taking a few classes on machining to learn the theories and science behind it all, it wont completely prepare you for the real world machine shop. Its a very cool job and I have no regrets on my career path, but expect long hours and to be treated like shit for the first few years until you can prove yourself.

[22:11:44] Comment: dyz7o7n by hanna_kin : I initially thought this was an accident. Reading the info in this link 
http://darkhistories.com/episodes/joshua-maddux-boy-chimney/
caused me to change my mind.

These three points in particular make foul play a much more likely scenario.


1.The cabin owner insists that it was impossible to access the chimney from above due to a grate having been installed. It had been removed and scrapped during the initial stage of cabin demolition.


2. Josh was naked from the waist down when found, wearing just a thin thermal top, his clothing had been removed, folded and located along with his shoes and socks near the fireplace hearth.


3. The final detail that convinced me this was no accident is that what was blocking the fireplace inside the cabin was not a dresser or bureau or furniture that belonged in that spot but a section of a breakfast bar that had been ripped from the wall and used to block the fireplace.

I doubt Josh would've stripped naked inside the cabin in order to go outside to enter the cabin via the chimney which the cabin owner insisted was impossible.

Why would Josh attempt to enter and climb the fireplace from inside the cabin? I can see removing your clothing to keep it soot and debris free but removing your underwear? Wouldn't most males want to protect their genitals? Why would he strip down inside the cabin prior to going outside to climb down a chimney to enter a cabin he was already in?

When was the breakfast bar ripped from the wall and used to block the fireplace and why?

Really a shame the way this case was handled.

As soon as you're using a trusted third party you lose all of the benefits of the blockchain and instead just deal with it's increased complexity for no practical gain. Luckily this program doesn't seem too stupid. It looks like (though I can't tell for sure) they're using centralized systems for authentication and payments and just after that using ETH to log the transaction. What is the practical benefit of logging the transaction in ethereum? IrisGuard already did the authentication we're already trusting them, they could just share their transaction log with WFP.

[22:13:40] Comment: dyz7o8t by AndrewRemillard : Good questions! 

Yes, you are interpreting my data correctly. My understanding is that the country of origin does not have a direct bearing on CPM. While the local market may tend to favor local production, the location of production doesn't itself impact revenue. 

From what I have seen, I think India is still in its very early stages of development both from a YT perspective as well as overall economically. They are still a couple of decades behind China but they are certainly working to take their place on the world's stage. 

And since China has banned YT, it represents the largest potential market for YT producers. And since its population is almost if not greater than China's, and it is growing much faster than China (whose population is actually shrinking now) it really represents probably the best bottom floor opportunity in literally the world.

I will have to go back through the four years I have been doing this and see what I can find out about India's growth over that time. I know it was only a few months ago that I noticed they were near the top of the list fairly consistently. 

Thanks for some thought provoking questions. posted to submission: Just curious how good or bad is ad revenue / CPM right now? I always predicate my guess of channel earnings with $1 per 1000 views, but i'm beginning to think that isn't the norm anymore?

[22:15:11] Comment: dyz7wgx by spiderhoodlum : Others have already said a lot and made some great points, but there's one that I see missing that I would like to add: Echo unfortunately reminds me much more of Gina than of Lexa. While it's totally believable that Becho would happen in space, we didn't actually get to see their (romantic) relationship start, which for me, seriously decreases buy-in. Similarly, Gina and Bellamy's relationship was introduced by them kissing in the premier of S3, leaving us to say, "huh? Oh, okay, I guess it's been three quiet months, makes sense he'd find someone." At least this time we've actually seen Echo before and know much more about her than we did Gina, but both relationships were introduced in a season premier following a time jump and had an off-screen start. Becho seems kinda doomed, and I sincerely hope that Echo has more of an independent storyline this season. I also hope she doesn't get fridged, but I don't think that'll happen. posted to submission: Clexa= Becho ?

Now, when you use Presenter View in Powerpoint your slideshow will show on the projector while you have the presenter view on your local computer, with the slides covering that logo you put as the background. When the slide show ends (or you escape out of it) the background image on that extended desktop will be uncovered and appear on the screen.

Since I overthink everything, my reaction is to log some of my thoughts in a journal and try to determine if I totally missed the point of books that disappointed me. Sometimes that's the case. 

It's sort of like hearing a style or work of music you initially hate, then working to come to an appreciation of the style. Sometimes it's worth the effort. Not often. I envy those who can easily and without regret put a book down that isn't working for them.

That being  said  if your budget isn't too much of a concern then this would play all the new shit pretty well and you'd be able to upgrade the GPU later if need be.

I scooped franmil anyways but I'm confident at the end of the season forto outperforms franmil posted to submission: The Padres are calling up Franmil Reyes from El Paso. The power-hitting outfield prospect recently hit eight home runs in a five-game stretch. No word on the corresponding move. I believe @EVT_JClark had it first.

[22:18:11] Comment: dyz821y by Karmasbytch : Community college does give out aid even if you don't know what you want to do.

In my state you have the option of a direct transfer degree, formally called assoicate in arts and science/general studies.

IF you know what you want to major in or figure out what you want to major in during your CC studies, you can get a transferable AA degree in what you want to major in (accouting, business, computer science ect)

If you know you want to major in a math/science heavy field like engineering,  biology, medicine or computer science or Fiance, then there is an Associate in Science degree.


For the completly clueless there is what is called the Direct Transfer Degree in Arts and Science.  Gives you some wiggle room to try out some classes in business, hospitality, you can even take a carpentry class or two to figure out what you want to do.  It also requires you to take a wide range of gen ed classes like a couple science lab based classes, math, English, intro to computers, history and a couple foreign language classes.  

In a nutshell, when you complete the direct transfer in Arts and Science, not only do you walk away with an AA degree, you've knocked off 99.9% of all those pesky "gen ed" classes virtually every 4 year school in our state requires for *any* major.

So my advice is-until you figure out your major, find out if your community college offers any type of direct transfer degrees and what is required to earn them, and work on your state's/community college's version of the Direct Transfer in arts and science degree. posted to submission: What should I major in community college if I don't know what I'm doing yet?

It has a bit more weight to it and feels more natural in my hands. Definitely more similar to the Xbone controller than the DS4. 

It's good to note that the A/B and X/Y buttons are opposite on each controller, which can be *reeeeeallly* annoying if you're used to one layout or the other. You'll have this problem regardless of the controller you use... but it's worth mentioning.  posted to submission: /r/NintendoSwitch's Daily Question Thread (05/14/2018)

Society insists on measuring us relative to others, which is really ramming the point in our faces that "we must work together". Have you ever tried getting everyone in society to agree on something? Society just isn't like that. Society's view of a "leader" and a "follower" is measured against their agenda. 

One place where leadership needs to happen more, IMO, is in people's own lives. Nobody cares about your life as much as you care about your life. Leading in your own life is what keeps you out of 'victim' mode. posted to submission: I wish society was more accepting towards people who just want to be followers rather than leaders.

[22:22:24] Comment: dyz8a5m by kylegetsspam : The new Necromancer skeleton node basically obviates Escape. I'm playing a melee skeleton build in Flashback. I tried Escape briefly (200% skeleton movement speed before any other mods and buffs!) but it didn't seem worth it.

I have ten skeletons and with From Dust I can summon five per cast. Thus, it's very easy to pop half my army right into the next pack -- which they then destroy with 100% accuracy and Melee Splash. So, I run through the map casting skeletons directly into mob packs with specters trailing behind casting GMP things to assist in the clear and nine zombies just getting in the mobs' way to keep them off me.

I guess the item's original flavor is still there: it's still best for non-Witch summoners. But, good lord, Necromancer is *so* much more powerful than any other summoner situation that there's no reason not roll one. posted to submission: As a Diamond Supporter, I just want to say a big thank you to Grinding Gear Games!

[22:23:07] Comment: dyz8a65 by KamahlFoK : The trebuchet is just an easy trap to fall for, and we found that reloading helps to ensure you don't have more than one survivor basically doing nothing all game (their turn comes, they chuck 3-6 dice, all done). It's a useful tool (primarily for keeping the horde thinned out or dealing with a runaway Necromancer), but it can become too easily abused if you have several people on it.

Given the impending reprint of all expansion content (character and enemies alike), the prices should also plummet on non-KSE options. posted to submission: Enjoying Retail Green Horde, What next?

[22:23:10] Comment: dyz8a66 by mysticrudnin : Your deck is going to crush the people that are going up to 40 or more.

When you have 5 must-answer rares late in the league, you're going to see them *every* game. Every card you draw is going to be gas - no filler. It's going to be very obvious that the lower count is much better, I think.

When people are deciding 40 or 41, it can be hard to see the difference. But if you're deciding 30 or 40, you're going to see the difference almost every game. posted to submission: Should you always strive to have the lowest possible amount of cards in your deck?

[22:23:44] Comment: dyz8a6i by zerozed : I came over from a long line of Nexus devices, the last being a Nexus 6P.  I had been on Project Fi (which requires a Nexus/Pixel) but was leaving for greener pastures.  Like you, I got a 3t.

I couldn't have been happier.  I've had nothing but a positive experience with the 3t.  Granted, like my Nexus devices I've chosen to run ROMs instead of stock.  I stayed on OOS based FreedomOS for ages and never had any significant issues.  Since that ROM has reached EOL, I've switched over to NitrogenOS and remain very happy.

Everybody has a right to their own opinion about devices.  I will say that despite having some of their own "issues," OnePlus has never produced a phone that bootloops like the Nexus 5x or has catastrophic battery failures like the Nexus 6p.  The 3t has nearly identical specs to the OG Pixel (except more RAM) and it costs about 45% less back when both devices were new.  That's a tremendous amount of savings & value.  I never expected the 3t to have tremendous resale value--why would it when the brand remains fairly niche in North America?

I'm not a OnePlus fanboy--in fact, my next phone will likely be something else because OnePlus pricing has been creeping up.  But I've been happy with the 3t.  It proved to be a worthy alternative to the discontinued Nexus line for me at least. posted to submission: I bid this sub adieu

[22:24:15] Comment: dyz8i8d by nugbrain4 : The thing with sports games like Madden though, is that after ~30 releases they've reached the point where nigh on every aspect of the real world sport is covered by some sort game mechanic.

The difference each year is that everything interacts just that little bit smoother, with slightly better graphics. That might not seem like much but it can make the game enjoyable for a player, which coupled with updated rosters and the fact everyone else will be playing it is enough to get people to fork out year after year.

[22:25:28] Comment: dyz8i9b by idrive2fast : >Three sentences. No arguments.

>What makes a boy in a dress look "like a complete fucking jackass?"

First of all, it's clear from the face of your [loaded] question that you have an agenda. I don't believe you don't understand this.

In any case, I already answered that question. Boys don't wear dresses - you make your 12 year old boy wear a dress to school, the other kids are gonna laugh at him. If you really love 18th century clothing and make your kids wear clothing from that era to school, they'll get made fun of for the exact same reason. This is not a gender issue, it's a "if you make your kid go to school wearing something that makes him stand out in a negative way, he is going to be made fun of regardless of the reason" issue. 

*Should* kids make fun of each other? No, but that's an entirely separate question. You'll literally never stamp that out either, kids will *always* find a way to make fun of each other. It is literally human nature. To be curtailed, sure, but if someone chooses to make a statement about how it "shouldn't" be that way by forcing their child to dress embarrassingly, they're the real jackasses. posted to submission: Your son isn’t a political statement, he’s a fucking human being.

I was raised Catholic and surrounded by Christians, so I'm kind of burnt out on the whole Jesus thing, but hey, there's a possibility there could be more out there, and I can accept that.

Honestly, if you’re living out on your own it’s pretty much the same price as if you went out to grocery shop. The people who buy food in bulk usually have a family. Try buying a small batch of romaine lettuce compared to their family serving. It’s significantly cheaper to get the family pack but I don’t eat romaine lettuce enough to buy a family pack so now I’m stuck buying over prices Romaine lettuce  posted to submission: Can one of you please drill it into my head that it’s not okay to eat out for every meal?

[22:29:22] Comment: dyz8p80 by BrandNewSidewalk : We struggled with infertility for 6 years before getting pregnant.  I was a wreck and developed severe depression and anxiety, to the point where I couldn't be in the same room with a pregnant woman without having an anxiety attack.  My little brother's wife had two babies during the worst of those years.  It nearly killed me.  I couldn't talk to them during the entire pregnancies.

You sound like you did the right things.  There was, frankly, no good way to tell her this.  From her point of view, it would destroy her world no matter how you told her.  She can't help how she's feeling.  She can help how she acts about it, and hopefully she will see that and eventually apologize.  The mindset infertility puts you in is not rational.  You think and feel and react in ways you wouldn't otherwise.  There is so much grief and shame and pain wrapped up together, and you have to be reminded every month, and every time someone close to you gets pregnant.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  

Even though you didn't do anything wrong, you are a sharp reminder of her pain.  Give her space and time.  I encourage you to welcome her back when she is ready.  Hopefully she has someone to talk to who understands (husband's aren't always the best at this.) posted to submission: Best friend is furious I'm pregnant

Not sure why. For The Dark Knight or Dunkirk, the Imax scenes were really awesome, sharper, etc. But for IW, it just looked... good.

[22:29:41] Comment: dyz8vcp by lucao_psellus : yeah, i noticed the equivocating reference to "Hamas violence", and while he does mention "Israel firing on unarmed protestors", this is riddled with the passive voice ("50 killed...2,000 wounded...9,000 wounded...humanitarian crisis...escalating violence"), so that's the only instance of blame being put where it belongs - on israel

it's disappointing, especially in contrast to corbyn and thornberry's much stronger statements, but i suppose even corbyn doesn't go further than saying labour's committed to "*reviewing* UK arms sales to Israel" as long as these violations continue, when he should be promising to *stop* all arms sales

All on their dime of course.  My girlfriend and I still do that cycle once or twice a year.  She's a keeper. posted to submission: Best swag item from a network vendor?

[22:32:18] Comment: dyz90vt by Lirodon : Whenever I've seen U.S. stations dealing with Amber alerts, they almost immediately hand it off to their respective news departments instead, and have it presented by the anchors with pictures and other analysis.

The only alerts actually mandatory on U.S. TV are tests and presidential messages. A station that produces local news would be more likely to cover anything like this, whether it's severe weather, a missing child, etc. as what it is: _news_. Actual insight and reporting is more useful than forcing a text-to-speech system to break into programming.

Even worse, because of the mandatory nature of all alerts, a station that is actually covering a severe weather event (i.e. a tornado) _does_ actually does have to pause for the official alert, rather than just having the weatherman casually pointing at the map and saying something like "Just got word from Environment Canada, _so and so_ is now officially under a tornado warning, etc."

The only reason our system is like this is because our local news outlets invest so little in the bare minimum of local coverage, that they don't really have the ability to go on the air on a whim like U.S. stations can. posted to submission: OPP issues Amber Alert for 8-year-old boy in Thunder Bay

But I know your pain bro, we all get that urge to literally punch pregnant Arab women in the stomach, I mean, who doesn’t, right? 

I also bet you are just as vocal about lead in your water supply, as with the Flint water scandal, where infant mortality rate grew by 58% over your national average? How about that fracking, causing permanent brain damage in utero.

[22:34:19] Comment: dyz90xc by katherinelovada : Mama Murray is Josh Murray's mom. She's notorious for making a bunch of fake Twitter accounts posing as random people to praise her son and bash his girlfriends. She would use these accounts to leave hateful comments on Amanda's social media posts. She was also hateful towards Andi. It was always obvious it was her, because she would post really corny quotes and Bible references and then go on rants about how these women weren't good enough for Josh.  posted to submission: Next couple to breakup

[22:34:24] Comment: dyz90xg by albert_9 : This game is an arcade version of the stock market and it has similarities to the real world. As it has its own closed market, it is not linked to the real economic.

This makes the game truly unique and something most people have not seen or played before. 

Quick Facts:

* Bonds cause inflation (Bonds issued by system, User buys them and gets them back guaranteed after x days with interest rates

* Credits and also Newcomers cause deflation because the system will hold in the beginning 70% of the shares of the newcomer and will sell them to the market for more than the book value

 * Users also have a private-depot and depot for their Public Joint Stock Company. Private-Depots are not visible in the shareholders data which makes it a useful tool to takeover another PJSC.

* Users will need 75% + 1 Share to takeover another PJSC

* Users will hold 30% of their own company in their private-depot in the beginning.

* Game has its own key figures, Elo-Scores and its own stock market index

* Chat in game to make communication better

For further reading please see the [docs](https://share-game-media.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/Tutorial.pdf) 


We are also searching for Tutors & Admins, so keep in touch if you are interested and have understood the game.

I would appreciate any feedback and thanks for your time. If you got any questions, feel free to ask

Best Regards,

[22:34:39] Comment: dyz90xj by Halt_kun : ____

>**Aura only needs manipulation if it is separated from the user. The aura surrounding a person functions as an extension of the body and can be used as such, like Zeno’s dragon lance, without manipulation. For example, you can move your arm normally if it is attached, but if Pitou cleaves it off, you’d need manipulation to do so.**

_____

I agree with that except if you give orders to yourself independent of your consciousness it also works see Autopilot.

_______

>**Youpi’s ability also doesn’t use manipulation. He is derived from magical beasts, which have biological shape shifting mechanisms. He’s just using enhancement for explosive cell growth, to enhance his natural ability.**

______

It's that or he uses manipulation with the enhancement to regulate how the cells develop. 


______

>**Killua’s lightning doesn’t use emission. The aura elongates to connect to the target but is never released or disconnected from himself. Some skilled transmuters like Hisoka, Machi and Zeno can use emission as a supplementary nen type to give it ranged functionality.**

______

 I agree too.


_____

>**Morel’s deep purple doesn’t use transmutation, his polar opposite nen category. IF it did, there would be no need to manually emit an aura core, since the smoke would already be aura, and normal people or people in zetsu wouldn’t see the smoke.**

______

[22:34:50] Comment: dyz90xs by Nnylaryt : Building off #4, confidence. The best thing suggested to me was if I was in a situation where I said something very awkward and we both knew it. To aknowledge, embrace, and laugh about it.  When you accept it confidently, other people often accept it as well. Example: I people watch, I remember everything and it's weird. I know it. In class I saw a girl come in with pretty earrings, I loved them and wanted to know where they came from. Fast forward to two days later I had on new jeans (they were ripped, right as it was becoming a thing), she came up and said "hey I'm so and so, those jeans are amazing!" Instead of just saying thanks, I of course panicked and said something like "OMG yeah i know, I really loved those earring you wore to class Monday, I couldnt stop thinking about them, everytime you moved they swayed so prettily." Yep.. that's who I am as a person. Wtf. But I breathed and laughed and said "Oops, that sounded so crazy haha, I notice everything and forget how creepy it sounds coming out, I'm sorry I'm Nnylaryt, thanks for the compliment, and seriously great earrings." And so began one of my favorite friendships. It not only shows confidence but also sets a slight expectation and explaination for future social mishaps, and it allows you to gauge up front who's worth your time.  posted to submission: am i allowed to post here? + loneliness

[22:37:02] Comment: dyz99s2 by AS118 : Honestly, after the revamp update, levelling happens so fast that it's a little too fast, imo.

The biggest problem is getting to such a high level that you can't do the union watch missions anymore without grinding a ton, which is a bigger deal when you haven't gotten the 30 phase token skill yet.

To level fast, all you have to do is set the channel to the same name as the zone you're in, and focus on grinding on Monday and Tuesday when the weekday warrior buff is up.

You'll shoot past the level of the zone you're in in no time.  Just doing missions without repeating is more than enough, especially if you do the dimensional dopplegangers on the character you're trying to level that day. posted to submission: What is the best way to level up, doing missions or repeating dungeons?

If you're planning on just showing up solo and doing anesthesia, this isn't the right organization for you. They more or less facilitate you, give you housing, food, translators and connect you to the locals who need the medical care. 

Also, keep in mind that healthcare and surgical/anesthesia conditions in many of these countries are archaic and will not have the majority of the equipment or drugs you're used to. We were lucky if we found Halothane available or a functional vaporizer at all. Ketamine/Versed/Morphine and a peripheral IV, get creative.  posted to submission: Clinical Rotation: Mission Trip

[22:38:38] Comment: dyz99tv by edwardshallow : Take same dose or smaller! Make the sacrifice!

In the morning of: fast. I find it can be easier to 'take' if I eat with a different mushrooms (a portobello or the like) as the belly feels to take the psilocybin easier. No idea if that's true, but it's anecdotal.

Soaking in lemon juice converts the psilocybin prior to ingestion, which makes it more bioavailable and intense from what I've experienced. I have a tendency to take 'truffles' (rather than mushrooms), and I swallow the lemon soaked truffles with grape juice or apple juice.

Make a comfortable bed to sleep and prepare fruit for after the experience. You'll be thankful for everything being in its place when you arrive wherever you're staying after returning from the beach.

[22:39:22] Comment: dyz9gye by l80 : >> Being my authentic self means I have contextually appropriate interactions with people that I have different kinds of relationships with.

> By that argument, the priests that are kiddie diddlers are fine because they are operating appropriately in each of their separate contexts. 

Really? That's how you want to play it? You think that fucking kids behind closed doors is "contextually appropriate"? And you really think that's a valid interpretation of what I was saying? I think you might be running out of straws to grasp.

> Same goes for fervently anti-gay politicians that turn out to be closeted. 

You're really defining people who are legislating against behavior that they themselves engage in as "contextually appropriate"? That's your definition of appropriate? Yikes.

> There is a massive difference between disclosing with discretion and behaving privately in the exact opposite of the way you publicly portray yourself.

Yeah, there sure is. And I never said anything to the latter point, so stop trying to shove your words into my mouth.

> It's also up to you to decide whether or not to listen to "condescending strangers". It's also up to you to decide where or not to have balls.

Listening is not the same as responding to. I don't have to take your advice to call it out for the bullshit that it is.

All of that said, take a breather. I'm probably far from the only person you're responding to, and feeling backed into a corner sucks. It's just reddit. We're all in this shit together, and tomorrow, your hastily made comment will be all but forgotten. You made a statement that, upon clarification does make a lot more sense. The problem is that in its current form, it seems like a cavalier approach to privacy rights, which IS a legitimate issue. 

You're also raising some important distinctions (albeit clumsily) that are worth thinking through when we talk about topics like privacy and authenticity. These are concepts that are never completely cut and dry and do need to continually be evaluated and thought through, especially when we live in a world where the goal post is perpetually moving.

If you're going to take the devil's advocate approach to defending a poorly articulated stance, there's some room for improvement. If you're desperately backpedaling and lashing out in an effort to "win" and justify your comment above, maybe reconsider how you're spending your time on the internet.

[22:39:46] Comment: dyz9gz0 by Newbosterone : Fortunately, this is malicious compliance, not /r/AskHistorians.  All I could find was anecdotal evidence.

You might be interested in reading [HistoryNet](http://www.historynet.com/the-gi-bill-cover-page-october-99-american-history-feature.htm):
> As the veterans began to crowd onto campuses across the nation there were, naturally enough, instances of “culture clash.” Lehigh’s freshmen had been required, since before anyone could remember, to wear brown socks, a brown tie, and a beanie. Those who did not don such attire could expect punishment from the Junior Vigilante Committee. But, when veterans at Lehigh chose to ignore the tradition, it was a rash upperclassman indeed who attempted to force a brown dink onto the skull of a man who might have fought on Iwo Jima or on the beaches of Normandy. The school paper, which was still controlled by “civilians,” ran an editorial pointing out the advantages offered by hazing, paddling, and wearing beanies. Few of the veterans bothered to respond; none took up wearing beanies.

There were similar experiences at private upper tier colleges such as [Johns Hopkins](https://engineering.jhu.edu/magazine/2009/07/gi-bill-college/#.WvnwvvnwZhE):
> James Stimpert, university archivist, said that Stull’s undergraduate experience of all work no play was likely archetypal for a veteran.

> “My sense is that a lot of the student traditions, such as freshman hazing, went out when the veterans came to the campus,” Stimpert said. “I can imagine an ex-infantryman, entering Hopkins in his 20s, telling a nonveteran upperclassman: ‘You want me to do something stupid and ridiculous like that? Buddy, I spent months in foxholes with shells and machine gun fire all around.’”

At some state schools, veterans made up 50-60% of the student body.  My dad entered a land grant college in the early '60s at the end of the change.  25, Married, one kid, and after 7 years in the military not willing to put up with "nonsense" as he called it. posted to submission: You want to know where I am?

[22:40:04] Comment: dyz9gzo by GracefullyToxic : Definitely. I live in a major city, and there a bunch of parks in my city. When my daughter was 1, I found this park that I really liked and started taking her there. It had all the bells and whistles to make it a good park: splash pad, walking trail, playground, etc. The only problem was that it was in a very low-income area of the city. It didn’t take me long to realize that many, many, many of the toddlers/children playing at the park were being neglected or abused. If the signs are obvious on adults, they’re even more pronounced in children. Their parents never came with them to the park. They would lash out at other kids and sob uncontrollably anytime anyone spoke to them. They would hit and punch and curse at their siblings and the other kids in the park. They would sit on the park bench and watch other kids play with an utterly heartbreaking thousand yard stare. 

Eventually, after about a year of playing at that park, I found a different park to take my baby to. Not to “shelter” her from their pain, but because it had begun to affect my own distress levels. I wanted so badly to be a light in those kids lives that I would over exert myself trying to help them appreciate their play time. It gave me panic attacks, so I decided that I had to find a better park. Now I go to a park where the difference is night and day. It’s bittersweet. 

Anyways that story is only kind of relevant, but yes, I could definitely see the signs of trauma all over those poor kids. I feel you.  posted to submission: Can you spot other trauma survivors?

From someone who has struggled: no one should feel like a burden on someone else, especially everyone one on reddit want you here. Ultimately, don’t feel guilty for liking what you like and do it. I had to realize that. I don’t care if it’s unpopular or weird. I LIKE IT. Even if it’s just that one thing, make it your lifeline. I guarantee other people like it and you can make true and real connections. And people who say internet friends aren’t real friends are full of shit. 

I did it with Buddhism. My entire family is Southern Christian Baptist. I had to get a permission slip signed to read Harry Potter because it was witchcraft. So when I told my family, they told me Buddhism was made up and I was going to hell. BUT IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

[22:41:03] Comment: dyz9m9b by drysart : > I've lost several domains this way.

If you did, it's on you.

For the main, non-sponsored TLDs (.com, .net, .org, etc.), when a domain expires and stops resolving, it goes into a grace period where the non-resolving domain name is still *yours*, and you can reactivate it for no fewer than 30 and up to 75 days; and only after *that* time expires does the name get truly released for someone else to register.

If you have a domain name that stops working *for over a month* and don't realize it and renew it; it's not really the registrar's fault. posted to submission: John Lewis, a major UK retailer, forgot to renew the domain registration of one of their public facing sites

[22:41:25] Comment: dyz9m9q by 99monkees : yeah a tool... but the real question is about the "activist" millenials.  Internet subverted Arab Spring ended dec'12, exactly when US began making the propaganda they export into an import business. The Internet has real potential as a healthy open social feedback mechanism but then suddenly it's promoted to be a medium for pushing secret social cancers? I'm not questioning millenials ability to be activists, I'm saying, after Snowden, activists are slowed down fighting a double battle, one in reality, and one in virtual reality. Snowden's disclosure (thru MSM channels) isn't exactly a breathe of relief for concerned citizens... no, it is basically an open threat to anyone who thinks about using the Internet for addressing critical social problems that don't conform to TPTB's agenda. like environment destruction. it takes some reality based common sense to bypass all virtual the double-doubting that the Snowden disclosure has manifested in US. It's part of the reason why a month after their Snowden story we all saw MSM twisting up something as straight forward as blacklivesmatter.  I kinda believe it's ultimately a question for that population of people who don't need the internet. posted to submission: A thought about the PRISM surveillance program and the MSM.

Dat is dus onder andere het punt, hij verschuilt zich achter een occasionele handreiking van "niet *alle* Moslims", maar spreekt zichzelf vervolgens direct weer tegen door vrolijk verder te gaan over Islam in het algemeen. Hij doet hetzelfde als bijv. Wilders met zijn "Ik heb het alleen over de *uitwassen* van de Islam", dat was ook niet bepaald overtuigend.

Vorstellbar schon, aber offenbar nicht möglich. Was nicht ist, ist auch nicht möglich. Alles in allem und als ganzes ist laut Schopenhauer die Welt immer so schlecht wie sie möglicherweise sein kann, wenn sie überhaupt sein soll.

Das ist ja die Bedingung, dass solche Lockvögel existieren, sonst wäre das Spiel längst durchschaut.  posted to submission: Ist Schopenhauer's Beweis, wir lebten in der "schlechtesten aller möglichen Welten", unwiderlegbar?

Short answer from that article is that getting enough protein and carbs throughout the day is more important than cramming it in right after a workout, but that getting something soon after can be helpful to speed recovery somewhat. 

It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Some chocolate milk will do it.

[22:46:23] Comment: dyz9vgy by rnj1a : Depends on whether you're a sword and board guy or whether you're comfortable 2 handing. A Dark Crypt Blacksword is amzaingly hard hitting 2 handed with just 20 STR and 10 DEX. 

It's a heavy sucker though. You'll have to put more than you're used to in VIT.

Which is fine. You'll have plenty to work with.

From what I can see you can get by with an 18 DEX (25 if Chaos Blade is in the mix)and as long as you're comfortable 2 handing you can get by with a 20 STR. And you'll probably be fine at 30/30 FAI and INT (cuts you off from some options but you'll be fine). Take you ADP to 50 and your ADP to whatever you want for an agility breakpoint and you still have room to play around with VIT. Basically you probably want VIT in the mid 20s. I'd put VIG to 50 (but you can get by with less if you use Replenish before tricky fights) and look at putting as much as possible into END. 

Crypt Blacksword is a beast on Stamina.

[22:48:44] Comment: dyza3k4 by jamesgdahl : Social liberalism, socialism and environmentalism are distinct ideologies, despite the three parties having many things they agree on, the only thing all three really have in common is the Conservatives are against them.

The Liberals are not socialists, they will vote with Conservatives on most economic issues, and are not really any more environmentalist than the Conservatives when it comes down to it, despite their excellent PR.  Liberalism is about social inclusion.  Conservatives are against social inclusion.

Socialists can be for inclusion but the socialist belief is that this is pointless without economic parity.  The classic argument being it doesn't matter if your society allows for black female LGBT CEOs if LGBT folks are homeless, black people can't afford college and women can't afford childcare.

Environmentalism and the protection of the earth against human deprivations finds them opposed to capitalism \(and so conservatives AND Liberals\) but also socialists who are not reliable environmentalists either.

Historically the Liberal party tried to make room for environmentalists and socialists but have been an overtly "woke capitalist" party for decades now, so for a socialist there isn't really all that much difference between a Liberal and a Conservative, and the Greens are on their own in Canada as parties pander to growth at the expense of the planet. posted to submission: The Ontario PC party has still not released a platform.

[22:49:01] Comment: dyza3kp by socaldadlife3 : Just throwing in my two cents to talk about tactics and style of play displayed by LAFC. Long post ahead. Look for TL;DR at end. 

I knew that this new iteration of B. Bradley was going to be exciting to watch. I see a team that isn’t afraid to build from the back and possess the ball, but I also see a team that is not afraid to move the ball quickly through the middle of the pitch. I could tell at Swansea that this was what Bradley was trying to get going and I’m excited to see how it works here in MLS. 

Most teams have responded by clogging the middle, which has stifled the attack a little (I saw that Ureña was making diagonal runs between center backs dragging one of them into the channels, which opened the space for Vela to exploit). Losing Ureña hurt a bit too as our tactics have changed to having playing Vela as a false 9 and Atuesta working up from the 10 spot to positions that are advanced of Vela at times. Makes me wonder ow Diamonde is going to change that. 

Our midfield is interesting. We don’t have a true holding mid that acts a shield for the defense as Kaye and Benny have a tendency to get high. But I think there has been been plenty of midfield discussion here at r/LAFC. 

What makes me worried though is our back line. Ciman is super aggressive and overcommits at times. It has worked thus far with WZ covering and Ciman’s athleticism. I think though that they were each a good fit nonetheless because they are both able to distribute the ball well. They should be given credit though for giving us a little more than 170 solid minutes against ATL and NYCFC. That said, the aggression makes it hard to keep the back organized, especially with ought a true DM (see above). 

Much respect to T. Miller for working on and improving his air game. He was much stronger with his catches and I couldn’t disagree with most of his decisions as to when he came out to come get the ball on crosses and corners. He has been unlucky in both his saved penalties, but who can complain about that?

TL;DR: Bob’s style is exciting to watch; back line scares me at times but holding up well despite no DMs; respect to Miller for working on his game.  posted to submission: Manager Monday

Probably the most important thing to remember is that veganism is about reducing harm to animals where possible and practical. If you've already spent money on clothes then there is no point, aside from fashion, on updating your wardrobe. For food there are a lot of places to get recipes from online. Cheaplazyvegan on youtube is one of my favorites. Be sure to take a multivitamin (I take Deva), vegans don't get much B12 in their diet and unless you actually eat a balanced diet you will probably be lacking here or there.

[22:51:53] Comment: dyza9ky by alexbeeeee : [REPOST]: apparently i used a word i want supposed to🤷‍♂️my bad

I’ve never directly dealt with this before, but my brother did a couple of years back (a little different, but something to relate to).  His girlfriend of two years was ready to settle down, and he was not (both recent college grads).  He was convinced she was the right girl for him and they did not seem to have any attachment/individuality issues like you seem to be describing, however.  She wanted to settle down, he wanted to “live his life” and grow for a little while longer, so they broke up and remained friends.

I’m a little younger than him and as a result I’m always able to get advice from him about these things.  He’s always told me never to be scared of the idea that I will never find another relationship as good as the one that I’m in.  Today’s culture instills that fear in a lot of people, you aren’t alone in that way of thinking.  What he found out, and what I’ve slowly been able to find out as well, is that there are a lot of people out there who will treat you like shit, you just have to develop a filter to avoid people like that (which can be hard, people hide their crazy very well sometimes).  I don’t think that should be your primary concern when making this decision.

The biggest things that caught my eye about your post is the fact that you say you don’t really want to be with him and that you feel like you aren’t going out and making new friends because of him.

If you don’t want to be with him now and have to force everything, what will it be like a year or two down the road if you still live together?  It will get harder to deal with, you will start to resent him, and it will be harder to change your mind as your name would be on the lease.

If you feel like you aren’t going out and doing new things because you just want to hang out with him, this usually isn’t a good thing.  Given that you’re only 19, you’re still learning and growing as a person and forcing yourself to meet new people/join clubs/do new things will help you find yourself and eliminate your shyness.  Being this dependent on someone will absolutely change the way you grow.

I don’t want to sit here and say I understand the emotional toll a breakup from a 6 year relationship would cause, because I don’t.  If you did break up with him, it would probably be tough for a really long time, but I think in 2 or 3 years you’d really thank yourself for it.  Locking yourself into living with a boyfriend you don’t want to be with is a recipe for disaster, especially at this young of an age.

If you went through with it, this would undoubtedly complicate things between yourself, your boyfriend, and the other roommate.  I think if you’re just honest with him and tell him you’re scared of being too dependent, you’re too young to be in this kind of situation and still need to grow as an individual, other things you said in this post, etc. he will at least understand where you’re coming from and not be terribly hostile about it (given, I know nothing about his temperament so this might be off).  It would suck for them to have to find a new roommate or pay the extra themselves, but this is a time where you have to prioritize your happiness and be a little selfish.  This is the next couple years of your life we’re talking about here; having to pay rent in a place where there’s a strong chance you’ll just be more unhappy as time goes on.

I know that wasn’t very structured or organized, I just wanted to weigh in and hopefully help you out.  If you do choose to sign the lease and stay with him, just make sure you’re considering how you will manifest future happiness and growth as an individual while still being with him, because that’s still very important regardless. posted to submission: I [19F] think I want to break up with my boyfriend [20M].

Of course, most of the reaction I’m receiving on here seems to support the article, but I actually had a few decent conversations with some of you. I applaud you for attempting to move beyond the bitterness and trying to better yourself as a person.

[22:53:06] Comment: dyza9lp by Dudeee12345 : I stress the 2 weeks point because clearly she must have left upset, or as she put it "I'm not upset, I don't feel anything anymore", which is quite passive aggressive and can be interpreted in so many ways. That's why I worry, because I know if we were face to face, we would communicate much better, and if her intentions are to end it. She would atleast say so, this back and forth is confusing... 

I told her we can take a break (ie. just speak here and there once a day, or every few days until she is ready to talk normally), but she said she doesn't want to do that, and wants to talk now.. so it's like wtf.

I brought the same point up again and she said "if you want to we can".. like no lol I dont want to, I'm suggesting we do if that is what she wants to..

You really value a speaker having a wide dispersion (which is good off-axis accuracy, right?) huh... I don't know, it seems like you think it's more important than I do. My reasoning is that if I'm going to be listening to the speakers, 99% (to exaggerate) of the time I'll be in the most optimal position that my room, which isn't that great for being used a as listening room, provides. I hope to GOD that that position is on-axis, and I'm pretty sure it is so faith isn't really needed that much. If not, then I have a SERIOUS problem that I don't know how to work around.

It makes everything more challenging the tracking for a couple days finding a place to hunker down and hope to god they come close enough for me to get my shot.  For anyone who using fields and cell phones they aren’t hunter is my opinion they’re out there for the praise and the fake sense of accomplishment. I’ve had some of them make fun of me when they see my gear or when the see me come with back with nothing. Which the to me hunting is the whole process from start to finish. And they way they start I see no value in it no challenge.  But you know when I take down that buck it’s the greatest feeling I can have because I know I truly went to go hunting.

FO4 is often said to be a bad Fallout game, which I agree with, but it's a decent enough sci-fi/post-apocalyptic RPG on its own merits, and the gunplay is worlds better than its predecessors. 

I also wish that Bethesda picked a more logical starting cartridge than .38 Special for all the semi and full-auto pipe weapons, but ultimately it's just a game.

[22:54:22] Comment: dyza9mk by g_s_h_p_d_m_h_p : The problem with comparing those shows to The Orville is that it's a bit apples & oranges. Mad Men had fewer than 100 episodes over seven seasons, and like Breaking Bad and even The Sopranos, is probably a lot closer to a cultural phenomenon than most other shows. Man Men was one of those most expensive shows to produce and took multiple revenue streams to get it into the black. It was heavily promoted and marketed with numerous stakeholders having a financial incentive to grow the show. From prime advertising placement to heavy cast promotion, Lionsgate and AMC worked to keep that show fresh. How many times has Fox killed a show because of shuffling its time slot? How often do they miss the mark with their advertising campaigns that they skimp on? Look at Arrested Development - they put it up against Monday Night Football, failed to run it during sweeps, under marketed the show and then went "Look, it's a failure!" They did the same thing with numerous other properties they acquired, and I would say did the same thing with Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I wouldn't put Brooklyn Nine-Nine or The Orville up against the likes of Mad Men and Game of Thrones, but I would say that Fox's business approach is to assume that every show should be a massive success out of the gates with a bare minimum of marketing spend and then react negatively when they fail to live up to expectations.

[22:54:37] Comment: dyza9my by Stan-Lee-Spadowski : I'll say this as nicely as possible: you don't know what you're talking about.

There were definitely mistakes on both sides:
1) Snyder mishandled iconic characters at the core level. And Warner Brothers had approved it. So we got a Superman that kills and doesn't give a fuck about mass destruction and a Batman that has fallen into killing as well.
2) Warner Brothers noticed that these darker versions of charcters WERE NOT the Box Office draws that they had hoped -- they made money, but they didn't KEEP ON making money. So they wanted to take their entire cinematic universe in a different direction.
3) Warner Brothers OK'd the initial script/outlook for JUSTICE LEAGUE, then decided to change it after the fact when it didn't fit their new cinematic vision. This is doubly their fault...they approved something, then renegged. This is where Snyder was "betrayed" because he set out to make the movie that was approved, budgeted, and filmed. And he did.

Warners didn't betray any fanbase. The diehards that frequent this board would only make up a drop in the bucket of the overall worldwide box office haul. 

The blame falls squarely on the shoulders of both Warners/Snyder for creating versions of the characters that just weren't making the money that their competitors were. Nobody is truly innocent, and nobody is truly guilty.

Look, there are aspects of Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman, and Justice League that I really really love. But it's safe to say that Wonder Woman has a much better grasp on a cinematic vision than any of those three films, it's also sounding like Aquaman does, as well.

As much as most of the people here love what Zack Snyder brought to the screen...it's the MINORITY VIEWPOINT. It's time to let go. It's time to enjoy what was given, but since it is a BUSINESS, Warner Brothers decided to go in a more financially (and critically) responsible direction.

[22:55:52] Comment: dyzaiva by Pseudobeau : I absolutely love this line; "How very patriotic of you to celebrate the suffering of other Americans".  My wife has been very upset by how the alt-right seems to have usurped the flag and patriotism.  Kneeling during the national anthem being called unpatriotic is a perfect example of this.  She believes we should take back patriotism as liberals, rebranding it as we go.  I agree with her, and i would like to use this quote moving forward. posted to submission: Report: DeVos dismantles team probing fraud at for-profit colleges

[22:57:05] Comment: dyzaivw by blender_head : See, this is the sort of thing I have a problem with. For starters, cause I think this would be important to you, I am deeply into the world of video games as well. I do not like the type of DLC you described either; content that is on the "disc" yet has to be paid for to unlock. But other DLC, content created after the initial release, is fine to me. Where we differ is in calling it "unethical" and why we choose to call it that. As far as I can tell, you think it's unethical because it is it done "solely for profit" and publishers know people will pay for it.
I ask: based on this criteria, how is selling a game any different than selling DLC? A regular game is sold solely for profit and a publisher chooses to fund a games because they are reasonably sure people will buy it. 

I'm not saying you're wrong necessarily that it might be unethical, I just don't think you're criteria for what is considered "unethical" are any different compared to buying a game normally. posted to submission: CMV: Corporate retail practices are largely unethical

[22:57:07] Comment: dyzaivz by najacobra : Agreed. And also, people are so quick to say Bananas wouldn’t have won Rivals 3 with another partner.  Yet he’s won alone and won with other partners. Sarah, however, has only shown to be capable of really succeeding with top tier partners, i.e. Bananas and Jordan, who have both won on their own.  Put girls like Rachel, Cara, modern Camila, and Theresa with those guys and they’d do just as well (if not better) than Sarah. Even Jonna has bested her in both a puzzle and a physical elimination (luckily for Sarah she had Jordan to save her with a head start).  posted to submission: Most overrated and underrated challengers

[22:57:10] Comment: dyzaiw0 by FearLix420 : Me as a low master Genji main, patience is everything. Ofc u need some good sense for projectiles, but the main point is cd management, but most of the time u spam LMB, if there aren't any opportunities u just don't go in. Then u need ofc to some kind of extent flawless execution, which u can just get by spamming him in DM and learning how to approach every single encounter and always think about ur positioning and movement what u could have done better. Getting consistant on blades is another problem, u should use it primarly to get a key target out in the beginning of a fight, like an opposing dps that would ruin ur teamates lifes, if u can get a second after that u are more than happy. Keeping in mind staying alive is the most important trait of almost any character in this game even while blading. posted to submission: What about Genji makes him such a hard character to master?

IMO I'd also pick up a villain over Sun, possibly Cinder since (until Yukari shows up) we lack an archer, or Roman/Neo since they're just that popular. posted to submission: If the datamines end up being true, I have compiled this list to show what characters from each series we're missing in this game.
[22:57:18] Comment: dyzaiwb by CapnTBC : Every champion probably wants on that MSG card but they're not all getting on it. I assume it'll be two mens titles and a woman's again I doubt they go more than three. Khabib wants on it and I reckon he could get it, so it just depends who the other is with Woodley probably up for doing a unification bout against the RDA/Colby winner around that time. 

I'd say they could headline the last december card which is usually one of their biggest as well if this fight was made.

[22:58:56] Comment: dyzaqkr by throw9away90 : > Yeah that means you don't trust her.....yes trust takes time, but if you're already thinking in terms of well there could be something I don't know, then you're already assuming the worst about your girlfriend. With this type of thinking, your relationship won't last long.

Agreed, well we've been official for well under a month, so it's still pretty new. I actually trust her from what I know. She seems very honest.  

And isn't it a bit natural to worry about these things on a certain level? I agree they don't justify snooping, but I think they're often on the back of a guys mind, particularly in the earlier stages. 

Thus, while I agree I fucked up, I don't think I'm just an emotional basket-case for being upset by it. I just need to talk about it anonymously with you guys and think things through. 

> This is a YOU problem. You need to deal with your own insecurities. You're choosing to freak out about this when you have no reason to do so. Have some self control.

Thanks, I haven't acted upon this negatively yet. I'm upset with myself for being upset, but haven't treated her any differently yet. It's more of an internal thing for now, and I don't want to it affect my actions moving forward.  posted to submission: When searching "sex" in her texts, I (26/M) discovered info that my recent girlfriend (24/F) probably had sex with her ex a few weeks after we had just started casually dating

[22:59:39] Comment: dyzaqlf by Deputy_Micspam : The fury of the storm was a comfort to Ezra. For as long as he could remember, rain had been his friend, and whenever it fell, he was sure to be out to catch it. The noise kept him company, stilling intrusive thought, and the coolness it brought doused a fiery temper.

He slept for more than two hours, a plague of dreams kept at bay by the veil of rain. Rest found him well, however, and once consciousness returned, he felt much better than before. Corvus (a bit disappointingly) had not joined him in his nap, but that was okay. He was nearby, and that was all that mattered.

"Ech..."

Ezra finally forced his eyes to open. It was dark, though his eyes had ample time to adjust. It took another few minutes to force himself to stand--that bed was heavenly--but he eventually managed that as well.

"Ku mudove," he greeted no one in particular, punctuating his words with a series of cracks and pops as he stretched. "Hmm... Agaan mer shahz'aan, [Corvus?]" posted to submission: Season 7!

I’m a huge Yeezy stan, but this is ridiculous. How can a “classic” album only be two years old? Yeah the artwork for 444 and TLOP is similar, but that’s about it.

[22:59:46] Comment: dyzaqll by snittermansconfusion : I can't speak for the UK, but I know that in the US, men are statistically much wealthier post\-divorce than pre\-divorce, while women are almost always less wealthy. I can find you the figures if you're interested. 

I suppose we're seeing rather different situations; I live in the American deep south, and most married women here are stay at home moms. Our divorce laws are rapidly picking up with the times \(it is state law that child custody be split 50/50 in most states, unless one parent is proven unfit by the court\), and I know in my home state \(Maryland\), alimony no longer exists. 

Here, as a woman, you are mostly required to choose between having a family and having a successful career, as we don't have maternity leave and childcare is prohibitively expensive for most. My boss has said flat\-out that he doesn't believe in hiring mothers as it "splits their focus". I would certainly rather live in the UK, even post\-Brexit. I studied there for a year and vastly preferred it to here. Your lot certainly has issues, but the US is in shambles these days.  posted to submission: Men of AskMen: What do you think are the major reasons why women fail in relationships?

[23:01:54] Comment: dyzayz3 by zdbetzer2 : It's only imperative to create a self-help philosophy *before* you start if that philosophy is integral to the plot moving forward. Otherwise, the plot should come first, and can inform your philosophy. Really, everything is related, i.e. Philosophy informs character, character informs plot, plot informs philosophy, or change in that philosophy.

I agree with free-writing to get a feel for who your character is. If character/plot *doesn't* inform philosophy, and it's the other way around, you could come off as too preachy.

The details of your philosophy depend on the setting as well; but to start, good details to start would be:

* Does your character believe in "higher powers"? Do Higher powers exist in your story/universe?
* Why does your character need help, or more specifically self-help?
* What are societal opinions on mental health and well-being? Does your character agree with these conventions or not?
* (This is dangerous, but:) What is *your* self-help philosophy? Sometimes the best foundation for a conceptual moral or philosophical system is rooted in what you're familiar with. posted to submission: What details do I need for a spiritual self help philosophy that my MC comes up with before I can start the story.

Phase V is under planning and will be built on the land originally being sold to Nuuvera.  They have 200 acres available and it's across the road from phases I through IV.  I expect phase V will be able to tap into the power plant that they built for the other facility, they'll just have to run a line.

I glided my fingers against the edges of the pages thinking about the first thing I should write down. I looked around the small coffee shop that I was sitting in. I glided my tongue against the roof of my mouth feeling that I was thirsty. A small sweet tea here cost about three dollars and I wasn't willing to pay that. 

I stared down at the book and reached for the pen in my pocket. I clicked it open and wrote down the words "Get me a small sweet tea" at the top of the page. A couple of a minutes later a women in a green barista outfit was handing me a sweet tea saying how she forgot to give it to me after I paid. I looked down at the book again a sly smile forming on my face. I picked up the pen with a thousand ideas flooding in my head I didn't know what to do first. Then I got it.

Your vows are promises and they should be something that allows you both to grow. It's easy to promise to love the person in front of you on your wedding day, but you're promising to live the person they'll become in a year, a decade, or longer.

Also know that your vows are to each other. Not to society, your friends, or each other's families. They and your marriage can be anything you want, and if you're being faithful to those agreements, you're being faithful to your partner. 

Finally, love each other like your love is invincible. No revelation, no lie, no weird kinky stuff in bed can take it down. So be honest. posted to submission: What should you know before getting married?
[23:02:28] Comment: dyzayzf by AnotherCator : It’s a tough one - we’re due for a new series but there haven’t been any solid leaks/rumours yet, so it wouldn’t surprise me if they launched in one month, but it also wouldn’t surprise me if they don’t launch for six months.

Ultimately it’s a trade off between how much you want to play the new shiny games and how much you’d be bothered by the 1070/1170 situation you mentioned. Personally I *hate* when that happens (like disproportionately to the amount of money actually involved lol) and have a backlog of cool low-fi indie games, so I’d be playing those until the new cards release - but it’s very much up to you. posted to submission: When is the best time to buy a GPU?

[23:02:29] Comment: dyzayzh by ___________a : It will be a while, especially after this year.  The big players were only able to release their new 2018 models very, very recently.  It's mid-May and most aren't even out in any decent capacity yet -- the 4k Aero 15 and Dell's 9570 for example.

Even a Jan/Feb post-CES launch of new laptops is iffy and not guaranteed.  For example, can Dell handle pumping a new Sku into their lineup after everything they're literally in the middle of  launching right now (2 in 1, clam-shell, new G series)?

Sure you can be hopeful in that they'll just offer configuration options for the new mobile GPUs (not even announced yet) but watching optimist fail is what gets me out of bed every morning. posted to submission: How long till 11 series laptops considering july release of desktop 11 series gPUs?

[23:05:11] Comment: dyzaz1a by EarlGreyBoba : **Sparknotes version:**

* Opens with a quote about online dating by Andrew T. Flore about exaggerating in an online setting. Therefore, he must be exaggerating.
* He asks you to bear with his profile for only a couple minutes. It will actually take more time to read this than watching the Star Wars trilogy.
* Claims dating apps are bullshit because it's all about window shopping. Makes sense, he claims he's ugly.
* Talks about honesty and dating sites, I guess it ties back to the first bullet point because I think he's making the point that people exaggerate who they are.
* \*rant about Chads ensues\*
* Oh, now he's talking about how those same profiles talk about how they're nice, genuine guys, but calls bullshit on all those.
* Okay here's the good stuff: he's gonna start talking about his Nice Guy resume:
* Says he's nice because:
   * He picked up a lost dog at 4 AM and found it home at 3 PM and he can prove it \(ok\)
   * He'll send you messages that he would say in\-person \(like you're a fat slut if he thinks you are a fat slut, how thoughtful!\)
   * Actually he said it's a simple greeting followed by a question about your well\-being.
   * Then he'll start probing your interests \(and presumably sex is one of those topics\) and if that's not how it works, he's lost about this whole game, so he says.
* All he says are hypocrites and repeat offenders of getting into the same situation they are getting out of by getting out of the app
* Says if you want genuine, humble people, start being humble \(irony right\) and stop being so stuck\-up.
* Claims this app is meant for people trying to get to know someone before committing to anything
* Asks a rhetorical question about the number of times they've been done wrong by some guy who got their number who only sees them for their body, then complain about it later.
* FINALLY he mentions his age! He's 28!!
* He commended me for reading this far and that I found the satire in that post \(oh so now YOU'RE playing with my emotions, I see how it is. Don't break my kokoro\)
* Claims if you're offended please speak now or forever hold your peace. You couldn't possibly offend him.
* Thinks that shitstorm of a paragraph would make great stand\-up. We should convince him it is and have him get booed off the stage.
* Reiterates that you won't get to know someone unless you ask questions then goes back to another pointless rhetorical question about challenging someone's identity.

*TL;DR: you won't know unless you ask him questions.*

**Truthful:**

* Read that shit on your own please. posted to submission: Just your average nice guy's dating profile

[23:06:08] Comment: dyzb7bg by BraveSquirrel : I understand the situation overall more than most, I just think this was a poor strategy.  If you're going to talk about "stolen" let's remember it was originally a Jewish city, and Muslims "stole" it from the Romans who "stole" it from the Jews who later converted to Christianity.  I don't think anyone has the moral high ground here, everyone who controls land on this planet has taken it from someone else, I just think it's pretty foolish to charge en masse a large gang of armed people over an embassy moving.  I understand why you're upset, and again I am not some Israeli sycophant, but I feel like those Israeli soldiers were purposefully put in a position where they had no other choice than to react with lethal force.  And if you don't want dead people, don't put soldiers in that position.

In my eyes they were stupid, but I did not want to see them get hurt at all.

I rode a motorcycle for years, while I don't bond with bicyclists I do understand being on a road with 2 ton death machines and people driving them not paying attention to a thing... but I also actually paid a lot more attention to my surroundings.  

That is something I think bicyclists could do a hell of a lot better job of.  Most of them (at least here in Utah) ride around like they own the road.  Yeah, maybe by law they have the same'ish rights as a car but physics is going to disagree.

[23:07:51] Comment: dyzbd8p by 404Freedom_Not_Found : Nowhere did I make any claims about immigrants being unable to become part of a community or that they are harmful to the social fabric. An immigrant whose cultural norms and values aligns with the place they are immigrating to will not cause any strain. You seem to think that because we hold superficially similar views, that I must align myself with nativists. I don’t. Gradual immigration that does not allow for the creation of minority-ethnicity ghettos is not a problem at all. 

You cannot create unity from difference. They are diametrically opposed. Unity is, in my opinion, far more important than difference. We like to think that people are independent masters of their own fate, but in reality we are all moulded by the cultural milieu into which they are born, and contrary to the idea that rigorous structure and expectations are bad for people, we have found that people thrive in the presence of such norms, and flounder without them.

[23:08:09] Comment: dyzbd8w by DoctorDDandy : It's definitely a skill to not compare yourself with others, but it's a skill worth learning. Another tool worth learning is positive thinking.

It may seem like bullshit but being optimistic does a plethora of good things, one of which is being a bit more charasmatic to people around you. It does a lot more than that but that is why it's relevant to your situation.

As for how to start learning the skill, it's different from person to person, but the general consensus is to fake it until you make it. Basically even if you really want to look at all the reason why the person, place, thing, or situation is completely shitty, just find one thing no matter how insignificant, that is positive. 

It's not always possible to do, but it gets easier with time and practice, and in my opinion, the rewards are well worth the effort.  posted to submission: I'm so lonely

But the reality of the situation with the amount of security, the layout of the speedway, the lack of many entrances, and the lack of buildings over looking the speedway makes the chances of something happening one of the least possible situations. Yeah I know the OP was looking out for others. But could have done it in a better way.  And to repeat never said that it was impossible. Improbable and impossible are two totally different things. But like i said we are all going to end up going to the same places at the end of the night regardless if there is an attack or if there isn't an attack. So in a hypothetical situation where there is an attack why not have them be the same place.

[23:08:41] Comment: dyzbd9l by AlfcatLannister : MTVs Made came to my high school once. Some girl wanted to be on our version of drill team. No one cared. They staged her being pushed in the hallways (painful acting) and acted like they were watching her tryout from the gym windows. The gym she was trying out in doesn't have windows you can peak in from the outside. 

One of the camera people wanted to interview me and my friends as we were clearly the gothy weird crowd. Asked how we felt about her trying to be part of the most popular group in school. We laughed. Our school wasn't like that and drill team was made fun of constantly. No scenes with us made it in.

It was all staged. She didn't make the team. Her life didn't change. No body cared.

Not super serious, but yea. Also I do enjoy reality TV and know in general it's staged. It's just fun. This particular episode is just bad and I saw why. posted to submission: [Serious] What personal experiences do you have with the media misrepresenting (or straightup providing false information about) events/stories?

It's not just your responsibility to maintain your relationship with your best friend, if he's got a rude gf, and it's getting out of hand, I'd maybe ask him "does your girlfriend not like us? We sometimes get a pretty odd tone from her but don't want to stir anything up" and let the ball be in his court more?

I'm sorry, I kept calling her your girlfriend lol it's your fiance! I doubt her opinion is going to change of the girl unfortunately. They might just not click ever and that's the way it goes.

Then there was the 21 day fix, that ended after 21 days and then he wondered why he gained it all back.

[23:12:18] Comment: dyzbj53 by Grog-nard : Makes sense, although it seemed implied by the OP that DARCI wouldn't be good against Argos. His crit area is easy to hit, so if the damage is scaling the same as with other targets, DARCI should still be (in theory) a better option if you land your precision shots. The catalyst, once obtained, nearly maxes out the stability -- so it seems like a great choice for the DPS phase. Then again, rally barricade + cluster rockets is probably faster so maybe that's why? posted to submission: To everyone looking for the next Gjallarhorn/game breaking weapon- look no further than DARCI.

She is principled, fair and always demands the best from her students, but she also works to bring out the best in them too. Flitwick is the cool teacher everyone likes, but McGonagall is the teacher who everyone respects even if they are a little afraid of them.

Force is justified when people attempt to infiltrate a country. If these people infiltrated Israel, what do you think they'll do?

Seemed to have nicely coincided with the big PUBG update for many users.  You may be already aware but this has been causing lots of issues on various games for many users and in many cases the only fix is by reverting to a previous stable version or doing a clean install of 1803.  Seems every creators update causes some FPS issue like clockwork. 

As more and more people are automatically updated to 1803, I can only imagine the cries of low FPS getting worse. posted to submission: Devs will be "shipping changes throughout this week" to fix FPS issues and "will not stop until players are happy".

[23:14:22] Comment: dyzbqwy by pandapiller : Hey there! Nice to see your dancing again :) 

Watching you, I feel like you are easily at the top of gold. You're clean, have good timing, and I can see the beginnings of some real body action during parts of your dancing, so I think you can break into the open categories pretty easily as long as you focus on one thing at a time. For example, focus on choreographing upper body movements into your dancing to start. It might feel contrived and awkward as first, but you have to have something to do before you can make that something look full and awesome. Once you have that down, you can work on using your core and back more to fill out the music. Then maybe you can work on adding some dynamic to your dancing by playing with the nuances of timing. This is hard to do without proper body action so that's why I suggested this to be last. I'd talk to your coach about an action plan like that and go from there. You probbaly won't see changes yourself for months since it'll be gradual and don't worry too much about results. Compare videos from now to next year and hopefully your coach will help guide you too. You also have the advantage of not being too flaily or messy so you don't have break too many bad habits so that's great! 

I do however, have to say that your partner is significant weaker than you. This, combined with the varying level of other competitors is one of the main reasons why I say not to worry about results too much. If there's any way to help your partner improve while practicing yourself, try that. I think she needs to start with drilling technique to strengthen her feet and improve her balance. That's a large part of why she looks so weak compared to you right now.

Anyway, I hope this helped! There are lots of other great suggestions in this thread too but just remember to take things one at a time, you may not feel like it, but I'm sure you're still improving :) posted to submission: Critique for gold am/am Latin

[23:14:27] Comment: dyzbqx1 by Usagi_Yotimbo : Where to start? I guess we could get bogged down in definitions since there seems to be some confusion. But I think we can muddle through.

But that doesn't matter both are belief structures that govern the actions of the believer. If you disagree, can you define political belief?

But I think more importantly finding active solutions to the stressor. It could just doing the actual thing or some healthy distraction. Take a walk, play a game for a little, and then come back.

[23:15:05] Comment: dyzbqxt by tepaa : I take that statistic with a massive pinch of salt. 

Tesla's have several advantages when compared against the whole population.  

* Teslas don't include bikes.

* Teenagers typically can't afford Teslas. 

* There are no old beater Teslas. 

It doesn't really say a whole lot about whether Teslas are a safe car to buy today. I'm not suggesting that they aren't very safe, just that it's not a useful statistic.  posted to submission: Elon's response to recent WSJ Article: "This is false.

[23:16:50] Comment: dyzbwmn by ldclark92 : Not the same at all. Vegas betting has been legal for a long time and Vegas based betting is legal. It's not just my world, it's the entire world.

And still, you have never answered my original question, who are these people going to games that weren't before? I don't disagree that it can be fun to gamble while you are at a game nor have I refuted that the new laws won't make gambling easier. However, the part I do not get from the original comment I responded to is that this will help attendance in any meaningful way. Who are these people who would go now that this law has changed? The main reasons keeping people from going to games are that they are expensive and people can easily watch them from home. 

So how does this gambling law change those facts? In fact, this new law makes it all the easier to just sit at home and gamble.  posted to submission: [Windhorst] The Supreme Court has just ruled 7-2 to overturn the federal ban on sports gambling. It's a historic day in American sport.

[23:17:05] Comment: dyzbwmu by xipirones : Lots to like here, though still a few question marks, the primary one being how feasible (read: how well trod a path is it) your immediate post-MBA goals are. 

If not, you run the risk of seeming unrealistic and a possible risk: a super smart, solid professional who flubbed his MBA recruiting campaign. No one wants that.

Please work that one out - I lack the data right now, but from my experience, impact investing right out of B-school is not a well-rehearsed playbook, and in general Big 4 tech consulting (or any kind) to the buyside is uncommon.

50%+ at B, W and MIT, depending on execution (involves clarifying the above). They also sound like quite good fits, too.

Your ECs, while impressive, are not quite what HBS and Stanford are looking for. Frat president and politically active are things H/S (especially H) will pretend to approve of, but are actually very lukewarm about. You’re going to have to focus on tangible achievements that are less prone to reader prejudice (if you can’t picture what that might be with regards to frat president and politics, well gee...).

Based on that, 20% at HBS (though your raw candidacy might be enough for them to want to interview you, where they would sniff out their suspicions). 

It doesn’t sound Stanford-y; you aren’t the kind of Big 4 person they like taking (and always do, in consistent but small numbers). Max 10%. posted to submission: Profile Review: 26M, 770 GMAT, 3.76 GPA

[23:18:29] Comment: dyzbwod by Lorenzo_Insigne : I have acknowledged that Chiellini didn't say some of those things, and I think OP is an idiot for making shit up. However the fact remains that if he's not referencing Insigne why does he bring up the finals? And once again, I need to tell you that I have no problem with Chiellini making jokes at our expense; that's part of the game. Demanding respect however, is pretty pathetic; how would you feel about losing to someone you hate in, say, chess, and then they come up to you demanding respect? You may give them that respect because they beat you, but at the same time you'll hate them even more because they've shown they're a bad winner. posted to submission: Chiellini: "People that talked about VAR and referees are now sad.

[23:18:51] Comment: dyzc28w by HailstormShy : I was really bitter when my uncle remarried after my aunt died, especially since they knew each other before my aunt died. I was 18, and some family members would say that she swooped in like a vulture to marry him.

Now that I'm older and have actually spent time with his new wife, I am happy to call her my aunt. She's a sweet person, she makes my uncle super happy, and their relationship is healthy. I think it was a combination of hearing rumors and grieving one of my favorite family members that made me feel so horrible about my uncle remarrying.

Either they'll come around and realize you two are happy and that there was nothing foul in how you got together, or they will fade away from your life and take their negative attitude with them.  posted to submission: I (32F) started a relationship with a widower (41M) whose wife was my best friend.

[23:18:59] Comment: dyzc297 by YaBoyEzreal : I'm not sure what you're trying to say, are you talking about programming languages? Or human languages?  

Yeah, in my case I knew Ruby beforehand, but a lot of my classmates did not, and no one had trouble passing that class, that I know of. Also if you think of the age that I learned Ruby it makes it sound even easier - and that was without any formal teaching, just following guides at an RPG Maker forum (and later Why's guide).  

>Can anyone apply simple logic?  

I think so, if they are taught. They may not make great programmers, but enough to make simple scripts, sure. If you were to consider programming as just another HS class, instead of a totally different skill - well, I'd say it's easier than some HS math - well, at least for some basic Python programming.

[23:20:05] Comment: dyzc2an by seanrblackburn : So I’m going to give some suggestions with the caveat that like someone said above you should have a contractor out and do a manual J load calculation, but also make sure that they will be pulling in mechanical permit to complete the work (ensures you’ll meet local municipality codes and standards).

1. Stick w/ Mitsubishi, but make sure you have a “diamond dealer“ install the unit. (Just type in that phrase and your city into Google and call the ones with the highest google reviews). They’re still the market leader for a reason, American Standard’s parent company Trane believes in them enough to just created a partnership with them. Carrier is decent, you’ll pay a little less but most of Mitsubishi’s units will be quieter, more efficient and have a longer warranty, I quote both for my customers).

2. Don’t go less than 18,000 btu’s (1.5 ton), but I’d lean towards 24,000 btu (2 ton) with your climate. For a garage that size in where I am in Fl most homes would need a 2 ton for sure if you want to use a lot it in the afternoon heat.

3. Inform the company you choose the indoor design temperature you want to achieve. Do you just want to take the edge off or are you looking for it to be 75 out there on a 100 degree day?

4. Insulate anywhere you can. Garage door and attic blown-in insulation should both be installed to help with efficiency and comfort.

5. Go with the best reviewed company and prob expect their price to be middle-high of the bids you get.

Hope that helps

[23:20:29] Comment: dyzc2at by Erozar : Yes, I know he was involved. I literally said he was a part of it. But chocking up him as a mastermind of evil, as this article is doing, is wrong and a gross oversimplification of the facts.

Also, I'm not protecting Oliver North, mostly because I don't really care about him. What I am doing is attacking the article itself: It's poorly written, clearly biased, lacks sources, and takes too many assumptions on the basis of its own poorly made claims. I'm also attacking the publication: It's a clearly biased media site akin to Info Wars, which isn't to say that it's articles are all terribly written and biased, rather that it doesn't have the size of readership that would allow for proper fact checking and scrutiny by the general public, as other major/semi-major news outlets would have.

Again: I don't care who Oliver North is. This could have been a hit piece on [Insert Evil Person's Name HEre], and - if written in the same manner and style as this piece - I would still have the same criticisms.

[23:20:49] Comment: dyzc2b1 by huadpe : Sure, a regulatory route is a reasonable way to go as oppose to a product liability route.  We do that as well with stuff like explosives which are subject to extreme regulation as well as strict liability rules for their users.

I'm just saying they're much more analogous to products where the government puts its foot down quite hard than to products like baseball bats which are essentially totally unregulated. posted to submission: CMV: Gun manufacturers should NOT be held liable for someone’s misuse of their products

[23:21:04] Comment: dyzc2b9 by Escaridole : I wouldn't really call it a "review of opposition platforms" because it dismisses Cox and Daniels within the space of a short paragraph. The only thing said about their platforms is that both "are running on a platform of change."

Though to be fair to the Bee's editorial board, Daniels has run unsuccessfully for this job several times before so there's plenty of information out there about him already, and Cox's campaign seems like kind of a farce. The five-point plan on her campaign website can be summed up as:

- Let's hire some people, or maybe just don't fire anyone, btw I'm a woman
- The law and the constitution are good but discrimination is bad
- Zero tolerance for "disrespect, retaliation sexual harassment, insubordination, and bullying" but don't worry guys nobody's getting fired, on second thought let's call it a "some tolerance policy"
- I will tell my own employees what our mission statement is. Yes, the current mission statement of the Sheriff's office. This will result in Accountability and Commmunity Outreach

[23:22:07] Comment: dyzc7nz by wicket-maps : A couple years ago I moved from Los Angeles to West Texas. Right as I felt I was getting settled - okay, more churches and everything shuts down on Sundays, but it's all the same stores and the same fast food signage, my boss and coworker had this conversation in my office. I was digging through our data, not really paying attention.

They're both parents, and my boss's kids are in middle school, and he mentions that for one of his kids' sports teams, an AR-15 was one of the raffle prizes. And my brain just - stopped. Like, back in California, a semi-auto rifle as a raffle prize? Like, there'd be lots of background checks and licenses and such. But apparently in the back end of nowhere in Texas, you can raffle off a semi-auto rifle for a kids' softball team - and not check whether the person buying is a violent felon or something? Like, what? The fuck?

That and the overheard conversation at a networking event, where two guys who work for different banks rattled off gun model numbers and add-on parts they had with less passion than I've heard about... pokemon cards. No indication of ever *using* these weapons for anything, no mention of hunting or target shooting, just rattling off brands and numbers of lethal tools. It still shakes me up thinking about it. posted to submission: What’s the biggest culture shock you ever experienced?

If you're trying to decide between the 7b and the WA87, If you record drums the 7b is a really good mic for snares and hats as well and is a wonderful mic for broadcasting. 

Also the 7b needs a lot more gain to sound good compared to what I have heard about the WA87 and my personal setup doesn't have an interface with enough gain to support the 7b without a cloud lifter (which I find introduces a decent amount of extra noise)

In this instance there is no documentation whatsoever how anything was measured.  I have not seen what hardware was used or even what software.

[23:23:17] Comment: dyzc7oz by The_Dead_See : 1. What is your training background (college degree? Self taught?) 

Degree was in design but pre-quark and pre-photoshop so pretty much everything I learned went out the window with the desktop publishing revolution in the late 80s. So I consider myself "self taught" from a software perspective but formally trained in the fundamentals at least.

2. Are you currently employed in graphic design or are you looking for a position? 

Currently In-house Creative Director for the Midwest division of a large infrastructure engineering corporation.

4. How long did it take for you to find a job? 

Years. After university I worked in pre-press and just freelanced on the side. From there moved into print and finishing, and landed my first full time design position maybe 6 or 7 years post uni.

5. Do you like what you do? Please explain why you do or don't like it. 

Yes, absolutely love it. Couldn't imagine myself doing anything else. Visual communication presents unique challenges. Designers are problem solvers, so there's never a dull day.

6. Can you post a link to your portfolio? 

Don't have anything up these days.

7. Any other thoughts or advice for aspiring folks considering this field?

Yeah, make sure you understand what designers do before taking the plunge. More often than not we're just a blunt interface between a clients ideas and a final product. It can be very frustrating and disheartening for new designers to discover that, and I've seen many enter the field only to leave it again a couple of years later. If you want to do your own creative work, be an artist not a designer. 

Also be aware that there are as many different experiences in design careers as there are companies with designers. Depending on the company, the hours can be long or normal (in my agency days I worked about 40-50 hours a week, present position is more like 60 a week, self employed was insane, around 100 hours a week), the pay can be low or high (averages around 50K for junior, 70-80K for a senior, and 100k+ for creative director), and the deadlines can be tight and stressful. You need to be able to be accepting of impossible sounding requests and just figure out how to work through the night to get shit done. Competition is fierce but as someone who hires on occasion, I can tell you that there really aren't many standout designers out there, so if you work really hard, and love design with a passion, and have a strong and relevant portfolio, you will find work fairly quickly.

Hope that helps.

It gives them confirmation that they aren't completely invisible to the world, and that they can still exert some kind of power over other people. I guess that would also make them feel a bit safe, sort of how *a girl clutches her keys while walking to the car, ready to fuck up an attacker's face even though the key is unlikely to be an effective defense tool.* It's about the safety and peace of mind that you have something that'll at least sting if you feel attacked, or want to attack.

[23:25:39] Comment: dyzcg04 by paroxon : To be fair, it looks like the river is in a full-flood condition (take a look at that bridge in the distance; I doubt the water is supposed to be that close to the road deck.)

If I've got the location right, this is [immediately downstream](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/30%C2%B014'35.7%22N+78%C2%B049'33.5%22E/@30.241805,78.8288751,686m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x3909a58434d2979d:0x854f99d49c9387e7!2sSrinagar,+Uttarakhand,+India!3b1!8m2!3d30.2246751!4d78.7986181!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d30.2432528!4d78.8259719) of what appears to be a fairly major dam. If the dam operators are allowing the river downstream to flood like that (the choice being a) flood the river or b) have the dam break and *then* catastrophically flood the river), they must've gotten a hell of a lot of rain in a hurry.

The wall of dirt looks flimsy from the angle filmed, but I suspect it was actually a full-on river bank before the flood scoured it away. If you zoom out from the link above to look at Srinagar as a whole, you can see enormous sandbars (floodplains) on the river's course throughout the town which give an indication of what the river looks like at full-flow/flood compared to its regular flow. The topography google has for the area seems a bit off (it shows the river flowing uphill, periodically) so it's hard to gauge the exact details. posted to submission: A flooding river in India breaches a wall and inundates a dam construction site

Maybe reactive gameplay?  All I can say is I’d really like for it to be super atmospheric and having long stretches with very few enemies wouldn’t surprise me.

[23:25:50] Comment: dyzcg0f by 7daykatie : Democrats don't cheat, lie and steal just the same as Republicans so far as I can tell.  Do you also think that non members of criminal gangs are all criminals just the same as members of criminal gangs?  After all, plenty of people who are not members of criminal gangs have committed crimes.  

Sounds like you learned to make asinine false equivalencies but tell me given the lesson you learned is "both sides are just the same" can you answer the question that was actually asked.  How does this lesson that both sides are just the same prevent the 
Democrats from losing an election to someone like Trump in the future?  You know like the person implied and like I asked about.  Here's a reminder of the salient parts of the conversation because frankly your attempted answer implies you didn't even comprehend the question:

"I think Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the largest contributing factor in Hillary loosing the election.

And unless we accept the mistakes of 2016 we are doomed to repeat them."

"Can you describe the mistake you made here and what you should have done and how that would have changed anything?"

So your mistake was you didn't realize both sides were the same.  If you had realized that, what would you have done differently (stayed at home instead of voting maybe) and how would that have changed anything (I've no idea what you imagine the answer to this is).

Because innate to the entire concept of "learning from our mistakes" is the arrival at practical solutions that make an actual difference and allow us to not be doomed to the same undesirable outcome in the future.  So tell me, what you would have done if you had already known "both sides are just the same and morally equivalent" and how that would have altered the outcome. posted to submission: Florida to monitor Broward election chief after judge finds ‘unlawful’ ballot destruction in Wasserman Schultz race

[23:26:29] Comment: dyzcg11 by isentr0pic : No noble, impressive reasons here. I just think it's fun.

An analogy: In the Japanese game of shōgi, good players will often build arrangements with their pieces called fortresses; formations that are optimal for a certain style of play. The king piece is always hidden behind this fortress, guarded by powerful generals. To a novice, these fortresses seem impossible to break through. However, there are always kinks in the defence; always a technique or two that can be used to smash through the generals, make the king run and finally succumb to defeat. Part of becoming a good shōgi player is learning about these techniques and applying them: it's always a thrill to see your opponent's fortress come crashing down.

Physics is like playing shōgi on an infinitely large board with the universe as your opponent, where one fortress surrounds another fortress. Each fortress is more condensed and well\-placed than the last; sometimes it's hard to be sure whether it's even possible to break them down... but when they finally do, it's a feeling like nothing else. posted to submission: Why do you study or research physics?

[23:26:52] Comment: dyzcg1h by SupaTiger : I think the real issue with Chelsea is that her edit is a direct contradiction to what the show is supposed to value. Season after season we keep hearing how important "BIG MOVEZ" are in modern Survivor. We've had this shoved down our throats for so long now, we're inclined to believe it is what production/Probst value. Enter Chelsea, a sweet, yet cunning girl who knew what she was doing every step of the way, and was a very proactive player in the game. She was a major factor in the decisions to boot both Brendan and Bradley \(BIG MOVEZ\) however the edit has ignored her despite her doing exactly what production tells us they value. The real issue with Chelsea is not that she is purple. It's that she came to play and make the big moves production supposedly loves and was largely ignored. If this season is any indicator of what the show values, it shows that it doesn't value BIG MOVEZ, but only values players who will play into their gimmicks/twists.  posted to submission: Everyone here loves Chelsea because they think production/probst hates her

Do I want him to be a good president and accomplish good things? definitely. I don't want the next few years to go to waste and to not make progress. Regardless of if I think he will accomplish good things, I want him to.

However, him making progress and doing impressive things won't make me like him as an individual. posted to submission: People who hate Trump, what would he have to accomplish for you to like him?

[23:26:58] Comment: dyzcg1n by Doctor_24601 : This is where I get confused. 
I was not raised Jewish, basically no religion as a whole. My grandfather on my mother's side married a Mormon woman and had my mother, so her mother was not Jewish, and all in all it became incredibly confusing. 
From what I understand, unless I were to convert, I am not Jewish; but I was always raised to know that I had Jewish heritage. If that makes sense?

[23:27:36] Comment: dyzcljy by SmokingPuffin : >I would agree with that but I think that a free market system makes it easier for players to be able to increase costs as well.  

That really depends on the market.  Free market housing is not at all easy to increase costs for realtors or developers.  We have all manner of regulations that are motivated by making home ownership a profitable enterprise.  On the other hand, health care is a market where the players have considerable pricing power, and only part of that is down to industry\-supported regulation.

Still, free market healthcare is very good at controlling costs.  As a comparison point, look at the veterinary care market in America today.  Veterinarians and veterinary specialists are highly educated and provide quite similar services as human doctors, and they bill by fee for service like human doctors.  However, the cost is almost always borne entirely by the animal owner, which means a few things.  One, costs are quite well controlled; getting a biopsy for a cat is a fraction of the cost of getting a biopsy for a human.  Two, access to care isn't gated by anyone; you call a specialist and book an appointment with no need for referral or insurance approval.  Three, only people with money get veterinary care.

>Perhaps but most if not all of the real world success stories of countries which have managed to cut costs in those industries did so not by a free market approach but by a mixed market approach. So I'm still not sold on the idea of such things being feasible. I think there are some issues on the supply side of these industries which makes these things more difficult to solve than simply subsidizing demand.

The reason why we use mixed market approaches in healthcare and education is not that free market approaches are bad at reducing costs.  The problem is that we do not like the market outcomes; more specifically, because we don't like the low quality of service a free market presents to the poor.

If what you care about is getting the most efficient service per dollar, the free market is going to provide that.  It doesn't have much to say about what to do with the people with too few dollars. posted to submission: A jobs guarantee is a flawed idea

I make coconut oil all the time with great success but I don't think it absorbs sublingually very well, even when I make it super potent. I use them more for gastrointestinal ingestion and enjoy the long lingering  highs  from fat  based edibles. 

I want to make a decent alcohol or glycerine based tincture for day time consumption.

Say I repeated m experiment and let it sit a day and then strained. How many 'doses' do you think I'd get? I was looking to at least recreate what I have in edibles which is a light dose at 0.1, medium at 0.2 and high dose at  0.3. So I would expect 5 medium doses from a gram.

Check out his Maron pod a few years ago if you liked this interview.  

The call to Sal was great too.  One thing I thought during that segment: Bill rolled through the people in sports most likely to throw a sports game in the legal betting world.

As is the case for many of us, it's actually going to these places and appreciating the scale and force of things you and no one has any control on. It's nature at its liveliest. Consider that this stuff coming out and the landscapes built by eruptions has traveled all the way from the earth's mantle in many cases. I find that mind boggling. Add to this that studying rocks is like forensics work. You do field work to examine the extend of a volcanic deposit, reconstruct potential eruption scenarios for eruptions that were not monitored/too old. You try to look at every detail, chemistry, physical appearance, its mineral content, the chemical variations within the minerals, the bubbles/vesicles to reconstruct. It's fascinating detective work!

No, you dolt. It’s simply a nice gesture, especially if the partner doing the proposing has planned to have a friend or photographer take photos during the proposal. It’s not overly vain to want to look your best photos you will treasure forever. 

My mom is not remotely someone I would deem high maintenance (she gets haircuts at great clips and shops at j.c. penney’s and kohl’s), and even she was mad my dad couldn’t come up with a reason for her to shower and change into something nice before proposing.

[23:29:26] Comment: dyzcqk3 by Mr__Andy : taking 26 episodes to give us a remake of the 2 diaboromon movies which are already copies of each other anyways. Not a real explanation to anyone's motivations or if that was the real gennai, or any explanation from the 02 crew of what had happened and how they were caught (no, what nijishima does is not an explanation). No word on what happened to Maki, to her digimon, or if Nijishima really died (I guess yes). The 02 crew is only shown in shadows, and they talk about "the four of them" even tho there's clearly five and one of them has Ryo Akiyama's silouette.

I still had hopes until this last batch, but at the end it was all shit. Specially when every batch has had a 75% of nothing happening bullshit which could be used to fill all these gapes. posted to submission: [Spoilers] Digimon Adventure tri. 6: Bokura no Mirai [Discussion]

[23:29:52] Comment: dyzcqkx by zantasu : Ok fair enough, I misread. I won't argue against that being anecdotal, but considering that Bungie has not and will not ever give us the exact details of their matchmaking systems, it's all we have. I *will* say, however, that the sheer number of reports on Bungies forums and reddit (as well as my own experiences) gives the claim credit, regardless of being anecdotal.

Bungie specifically said that Glory is separate from SBMM. Even if they hadn't, it's obvious they're measured separately, since the accrual and degeneration is handled differently. There's absolutely no mention of win/lose streaking in SBMM, or automatic daily/weekly loss of points, and the fact that players who don't have Claymore are already facing groups that do makes it obvious that the Glory brackets have no bearing on matchmaking. posted to submission: Competitive loss streaks are such a slap in the face to solo players.

[23:30:16] Comment: dyzcqlf by BlueLaceSensor128 : Exactly, where does it end? The implication is that the art leads to more of the negative action, be it slave abuse or rape, and so censorship (or at least self-censorship) is preferred. 

Think about a show like It's Always Sunny that depicts awful people doing awful things. Are they always supposed to show the bad guy getting theirs? Like what if a show had nothing but terrible people winning in life and never served up anything close to a moral lesson to the audience. They could even show honest hardworking people getting the shaft every episode. Music videos and radio stations would ban drug and gun references.

Take it further. Most people's understanding of the Satanic Bible would almost certain lead them to suspect it's filled with all sorts of evil encouragement, theft, murder, probably drinking blood or something. (My understanding is that it's not what you'd expect.) But if you had a vote tomorrow, most people would probably vote to ban it under similar lines of thinking. But they'd open up the door for the Bible to get its own ban for its own hate speech.

It seems like it always hinges on people's ability to be influenced by the information. That shouldn't be the art's fault. We should be able to depict awful people and awful acts. We should be able to express controversial ideas and if anything, people who aren't ready or able to hear them, be it due to medical, personal or religious reasons, should avoid "controversial idea zones" like most television programming, most websites, comedy clubs, bars, alternative churches/groups, etc. Because a lot of times, jokes are supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. posted to submission: CMV: There is no topic which cannot be joked about
[23:30:18] Comment: dyzcqlg by VerboseAnalyst : Reaction/Speculation on stats

Healing Passive: Looks boring but, seems integral to make Pyke work. It is greedy sustain and looks to be a pretty strong sustain. Has anti-synergy with missing health sustain (Relic Shield). Garuntees if Pyke disengages he can come back with decent HP. Looks to make him surprisingly resilient to being poked down. Whether or not is has a cooldown to proc will be a very big deal. I expect it to be like Garen and not have a cooldown.

Bonus Health > AD conversion passive: A game changer to find out. Both resist and health are required to be tanky and Pyke's health will be static. Pyke could have higher base health to help compensate but, he'll never be tanky. Does mean that Riot can afford to allow him to _actually_ do damage as this is a huge weakness. Also means warmogs will never be good on Pyke.

Bonus Health > AD Scaling speculation: Health Crystal is 150 health, Longsword is 10 AD. If it was 10% health crystal would give 15 AD for 400 gold vs 10 AD for 350 gold longsword. Rioter said they are building straight AD on whatever internal build they have. So 10% would clearly be way too high. If it was 5% crystal would be 7.5 AD, less then Longsword for more gold. 7.5% leaves crystal at 11.25 AD which is almost a match for Longsword's AD gold value. So I'm expecting a ratio between 4%-7.5% of bonus health -> AD. 4% would be a pretty bad ratio but any lower would be total trash.


Uncharged Q: short range AoE slow with a fast cast animation. Not quite point and click but close. Closer melee minion takes way more damage then the furthest minion which suggests distance or enemy hit degradation.

Charged Q: Text says single target. Can be cast while moving but, slows. Time to immediate release seems quick, time to max range also seems quick, and it seems you can hold the max range charge ready for several seconds. Sends them a fixed distance so the displacement is useful when at melee range.

Q Cooldown: I suspect this will be close or under 10 seconds baseline. Thresh + Blitz have 20 second pulls but both are stronger pulls. Nautilus has a 14 second pull which may be a bit more comparable but, Naut has a ton of follow up CC. Lux Q has a 10 second cooldown with a 2 sec root. So from a "Skillshot that allows follow up" perspective it, Pyke's Q, could definitely be near or lower then 10 seconds given other champions.

Whether or not Pyke can send out _many_ charged Qs to fish for a hit will be a very big deal for how he feels/laning style. He can move while charging it and wait to see how an enemy is running or wait out spellshield/flash. So I'll be looking at Pyke's cooldown first when he hits PBE.

W: Actually kind of basic. Exciting for surprise engages. Useful as a possible proc for passive when other LOS denials are not possible. I kind of look at it as just a speed boost.

E: The reason he's actually a support. Stun length looks to be decent. Shen's initiation and "supporting" crutches on his 1.5 second AoE stun dash. So long as Pykes E is 1 second or longer it'll do wonders for keeping him viable. Notably that while it's easier for enemies to respond to Pyke's E because of it's delayed effect. Pyke does have way more time and space to "draw" a line of stun. I'll bring up some combos in a sec.

R: It's a ground targeted blink that does flat damage. I actually strongly suspect good Pyke's will use it as an initiation tool and not try to hold it to be a worse Katarina. To be clear if it does 300 physical damage then it _only_ executes if the enemy has 300 or less health. So the "execute" part is really just giving Pyke a conversion to true damage and no extra damage. The main reason to hold it for execute is for the CD reset.

R cooldown. It's not global so it won't be 200 seconds. Evelyn is 140/110/80. Darius R is 120/100/80. Graves is 110/85/60. It's less of an execute then Eve or Darius. Eve's blinks away while Pykes blinks toward. I'd expect it to be closer to Darius R cooldowns then anything else.

Peel combo: E past an enemy to stun them then hold Q to displace them away from your carry when CC ends.

E: Initiation combos: W > E > R+Flash. Maximum range stun. Time the R and Flash right and might be able to limit how much enemy can respond. The ports do give you more time to chase an enemy with the stun. W > E > R is lower investment lower range. W > E lowest investment lowest range.

Q+E initiation: Speculatory. Depends on timings. Since charged Q is fixed distance you can put them behind Pyke. Can Q then E while close to them to put them in your backdraft? Or E then into a Q while moving toward them to put them behind you + stun? Will need testing. posted to submission: Champion Reveal: Pyke, the Bloodharbor Ripper

[23:32:00] Comment: dyzcvyk by Ouruborealis : > From what I know about them, they’re pretty second-wave and sound a lot like the women my grandmother dealt with in the 70’s who called her a sex traitor for loving her husband and not believing her sons were destined to be abusive because of biology.

Yeah Young does not argue this at all. You are reading a lot into what I said that just wasn't there and I have to take issue with it because it amounts to some serious, serious projection which is honestly pretty unfair. You are putting a lot onto me (and onto my argument) that isn't even written between the lines.

Of course other relationships can have problematic power dynamics, but in the context of the OPs question about housewifery, it's pretty clear they are discussing heterosexual marriages, and because it is the wife who is staying home, it's pretty clear they mean the more traditional type of relationship. 

Why you are taking something that is so generally applicable and so generally true so personally is honestly beyond me, but my beliefs are not an attack against you or any other woman's decision to get married.

It's a minefield out here and if you read my initial response less defensively (specifically the last two paragraphs) I think you would see that I am arguing from a desire for women to be able to enter marriages as equal partners, to redefine what marriage means so that it isn't exploitative and oppressive. 

I felt like I made that clear in my first post that feminism means not attacking women who make choices that you don't agree with. I don't believe in heterosexual marriage. I personally will not ever get married because I don't think I need the government or a religious institution to validate my relationships with another person, and I think that the historical baggage and what marriage represents is oppressive and exploitative and icky enough that I want nothing to do with it.
That doesn't mean I think you shouldn't get married, that if you get married you are being oppressed and exploited, necessarily, or that you are wrong to get married- do what you feel is best for you. But I see marriage as a economic institution, first, and something that is about romance or companionship like... 5th, at best. 

Broadly, marriage has been about economics and labor for most of history. It's only recently that it's come to be associated with romance and love.  posted to submission: What do you think of housewives? Are they empowering roles for women? Or do you not think they are empowering roles?

[23:33:31] Comment: dyzcvzv by skooterpoop : I think that this is a major theme in ToG.

* Khun undergoes the realization that it is okay for him to trust others, despite being taught to never trust anyone. He also has to accept his Khun heritage in accepting the Ice Spear as his form of shinsoo.
* I think Hatsu went through something during the Workshop Battle when his sword broke. He learned that the sword was not the weapon, that \*he\* is the weapon, and a sword merely an extension.
* Androssi often seems torn. She is a princess of Zahard, yet she has travelled up the Tower with one of the Tower's Most Wanted \(Anak\). On the second floor she tried to convince Baam that the only thing that matters is going up the Tower, no matter how you sacrifice, yet she has not been shown willing to sacrifice anyone since.
* I think your explanation of Rak was good.
* And, of course, there's Baam. He was taught his whole early life to be one way, only to watch as his teacher betrayed everything she taught him. He was trained by FUG to be a Slayer and fulfill their desires, and even FUG's view of him is different, such as Hwaryun wanting him to walk his own path. Furthermore, they even gave him an entirely different name, Viole. He has asked about his heritage from Garam, though he will never meet them. He has all these foreign entities put into him, even including the actual souls of others. And Revolution, which is supposed to reveal his true self, has been fragmented repeatedly due to circumstances, and his most recent Revolution has finally started to show purpose.

I think that SIU is a big believer in understanding and improving yourself. He probably went through his own difficulty in pursuing the life of a manhwa author and constantly says that he has much to improve in himself. It is through his self reflection that he has improved so much over the years, and Koreans in general seem to hold self improvement in extremely high regard, no matter what the career. posted to submission: [Disc]Sense of self = Combat Strength?

There are rumors they're thinking about removing that benefit, though, which would *suck*. But anyway, more generally speaking, for instance, when it's not 5% month for gas on the Freedom, I use a 3% cash back card for gas that isn't Chase, cause that's better than 1.5% back in UR from the Freedom Unlimited.  posted to submission: Airline credit cards, worth it?

So I know Belgrade is evidently called "The White City"

I also know your country kicked Austria-Hungary's ass so badly in World War 1 that it collapsed, a feat not even Italy could do with 7000 battles on the Isonzo. If it weren't for the German reinforcements and the Bulgarians backstabbing you from behind you probably would have won a 1v1 against Austria-Hungary.

You then somehow got control of all of the Western Balkans after World War 1 and had a monarchy for awhile until World War 2. Then a socialist movement overthrew the Nazis just about the time the Soviets were rolling in but they were independent from Soviet influence. For a couple of decades Yugoslavia was a relatively peaceful and reasonably prosperous country until the Balkan wars of the 90s when nationalism and accusations that only ethnic Serbians had influence at the highest levels of government drove it into civil war and dissolution. 

You still have a border dispute with Kosovo. I have never met a Serbian but I met a Kosovan whose uncles and father fought in their independence war and really liked his nation being independent from Serbia. We don't get too many balkan immigrants where I'm from, but I know some other states and cities probably have some significant communities here because we resettled many Bosnian muslims during the collapse of Yugoslavia.  posted to submission: What do average American think/know about Serbia?

[23:36:46] Comment: dyzd2yb by DougyAM : Bear in mind i say this as someone relatively fresh to the whole idea of CRPG's.

They are both excellent games that go about things in different ways.

Divinity 2 is more of a modern take on what an RPG could play like with a bigger emphasis on setting things up via the turn system and really micro managing every move.

POE2 is more of a classic style RPG that has been lovingly brought into modern times, but with its real time combat (with the ability to pause it) its a lot more... reactive in how its combat plays out because you cannot really keep track of all the multiple things happening (in semi real time) anywhere near as easily as you can with Divinity and its turn bases system.

For me the two are excellent games that do enough things differently that i would hesitate to directly make them compete and instead i would thoroughly recommend both, with maybe a slight nod towards Divinity if you are a newer RPG player and a nod towards POE2 if you are a veteran of the genre. posted to submission: Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire seems to be selling quite a bit worse than Pillars of Eternity.

[23:36:51] Comment: dyzd2ye by ZeroSaber39 : Hmmmmm, having a hard time deciding the best way to go about this.  Between an NP 1 Jeanne Alter and an NP 2 Jack who do you thinking might be a stronger attacker?  My current 5-Stars at 90 are:
Jeanne
Jeanne Alter
Tamamo
Gilgamesh

I also have Jack, Scathach and Vlad at 80.

Looking at the team set up suggestions I might be able to manage Set up 2 with if I team Jeanne Alter with my Lv 80 Santa Alter and a support Waver, that might b my best bet considering Santa Alter can be double buffed by Jeanne Alter


I was originally planning to rush my Rama and maybe 80 (He's at 54 now) to use him for the event but I wasn't sure since I have Jeanne Alter but I was also thinking rushing Jack to 90 might be a better option but not sure if Jack or Jeanne Alter is the better option (Especially if I choose to go with set up 2 and use Santa Alter as my AOE.

Set up 4 also sounds interesting though my Orion is Lv50 right now so he's another option to possibly power level but not sure if it's worth it over Jack or Rama.

Some Thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. posted to submission: [NA Rashoumon event guide] SHEBA Event Forecast: Bullworth Academy MMO collab edition - Demonic Capital: Rashomon!

Migraines, mood swings, depressive episodes, anemia from the sheer amount of blood I was kicking out, huge laundry expenditures from all the times I'd bleed thru an orange tampon (the one above super?) long before I should have. Honestly if I hadn't gotten on birth control I wouldn't have made it thru my teenage years.

[23:39:23] Comment: dyzd9ak by tuner678 : What’s your league rating? That really helps put this deck into context. Also care to explain to us your strategy? A screenshot doesn’t really help us understand what’s going on. 

Off the bat there’s a bit of synergy with shaymin and poisoning figures but that seems to be about it. The xurkitree, rowlet evo and lunala seem to be just figures thrown in there because they’re good figures, unless we’re missing something. Again, hard to tell if this is a “good deck” or not as it really depends on your rating and how well you play. This might get you really far in the lower leagues as they tend to lack good figures but you’ll probably also get slaughtered in the upper ones.  posted to submission: Heres a deck I've come up with.

[23:39:39] Comment: dyzde0n by LastBestWest : Exactly. Even though I find the current neoclassical-keynsian economic model more convincing than other economic schools, I'm baffled at the level of faith some people (including many practing economists) have in this paradigm and how dismissive they can be of other schools of thought. I mean, do they not know the history of economics at all? 

I suppose it's the (excessive and unhelpful, IMO) level of quantification in contemporary economics that breeds this false sense of certainty among neoclassicals. Perhaps this outlook is also due to the fact that economics departments and business faculties are often connected. In some universities, undergrads in economics might be getting less exposure to  social science methodologies and scholarly culture and more exposure to business practices and culture, which, presumably, would be less intellectually critical and more committeed to a single way of thinking. And, to be clear, I'm not saying business schools are all bad - they're good at training people to work in corporate environments. It just it may not be the best place to learn about economic theory. posted to submission: Stop Grading Doug Ford on a Curve

Some people mentioned how your tomato plants will get bigger, and I thought I'd show you what my tomato plants looked like last summer. Of course mileage may vary depending on the type of plant you bought, but I'll just let this photo speak for itself. XD [https://imgur.com/a/h2RlXKd](https://imgur.com/a/h2RlXKd) 

At some point I just gave up on trying to tame the beast, instead allowing it do its own thing until the fall. Before our first freeze I cut it all down and harvested about 60 green tomatoes. Put those suckers into brown bags and had tomatoes for weeks!

My personal experience with a state employment services is pretty poor I think there is a lot of value in posting your resume on  r/resumes for feedback maybe it's all stuff you've already heard but don't rely on your states Counsellors for help.

Women can produce on average 1 child every year or so. A single man can father a huge number of babies in the same period if required. 

Essentially, if enough people are going to die to warrant the draft then men are more disposable / less useful than women.  posted to submission: CMV: Women in the United States should be required to sign up for the draft when they turn 18 as well.

[23:41:39] Comment: dyzde2g by Wavykiwi : I dealt with the exact same thing when I was first married. A wedge between my husband and I. Yours is clearly overreacting to a very insignificant (in the grand scheme of things) yet valid frustration you had. Unfortunately you cannot trust your nmother with anything personal. Without trust what value does the relationship have? It sounds harsh, but the answers to those kinds of questions can be very helpful in deciding what to do next.

Definitely take some time to absorb what has happened and figure out what your boundaries are. Physically write them down. Review them before dealing with her. Her decent behaviour is just an act to get you back. That's why narcs are so challenging, the constant roller coaster is exhausting. Knowing that in a moment's time your words could be twisted and used against you. 

Strictly speaking, that headache is not what is best for you. Abuse doesn't stop when we become adults unless we recognize it and stand against it. A big part of that is just accepting that your wellness matters. That you should do what is best for you when the relationship is straight up toxic. This neither makes you a bad daughter or a bad person.

You are going through a very difficult season of life right now and it's okay to not know what to do. Distance and time are often what we need to gain perspective. No matter what you choose to do moving forward, please know that you are valuable and your future is worth protecting.

[23:42:08] Comment: dyzdjku by PlasticDong : I understand the landlords hesitance to let someone with a pet into their no pet unit.

 First of all, pet units are in higher demand and you can charge more for them. Already the landlord is making a choice by not allowing pets and accepting lower rent for the trade off of not having to worry about someone’s shitty dog or cat cause thousands of dollars in damage.

Second of all, the whole ESA “prescriptions” for housing and flying is total complete bullshit and I’m sure you know that. I can go online and have video chat with a therapist and get a prescription to classify my dog as an ESA in 39 minutes and $50. Not saying YOURS wasn’t legit, but the vast majority of them are not, they are people taking advantage of a system with huge loopholes to screw others. That brings me to another pet peeve of mine. If you had a dog, why were you looking at no or places to begin with? The sense of entitlement is kind of silly. Not only are you fucking over the landlord, but you are fucking over all your neighbors that live in a no animal complex for a reason.

Finally, depending on How many units your LL owns, the FHA might not apply to them and they actually wouldn’t have had to accommodate you at all, so they may have been doing you a favor right from the start.

[23:44:18] Comment: dyzdjml by OrokuSaki_ : I'm going through this right now.  I think part of the problem is I tend to get overly obsessed.  I never want to miss a workout and I beat myself up when I do.  I don't want to allow myself that occasional slice of pizza, bowl of ice cream, or couple-three beers on a nice relaxing afternoon.  

It gets very mentally taxing and eventually I burnout.  When I burnout, I want to throw in the towel and just be fat and lazy.  I wish I could find that right balance to be "committed" without being "obsessed" but I always find myself slipping back into obsession.   Sometimes I look at all the fun/enjoyment I willingly pass up and think "Why am I doing this?  Just for a nicer body?  Life is too short."  IDK, sometimes it just doesn't seem worth it to me.  But I generally can push that to the back of my mind and keep at it.   posted to submission: Does anyone ever get tired or working out or lifting weights?

But it's true that BSG kinda lost me in the later seasons, I had no idea what's going on and it felt like the writers didn't either. posted to submission: The Expanse (100% on Rotten Tomatoes) just got cancelled.

[23:45:34] Comment: dyzdpru by fuckusnowman : I'm a little torn when I come across people like you who make arguments like this. 

It's like coming across a man beating a child in the street with an iron bar. You intervene and the man says "hey, wait, the kid deserves it" and he patiently lays out what the kid did and how naughty he is and that the fractured skull and broken arms are an entirely justified punishment and the child has basically bought it on himself. 

Do you engage with the man? Do you debate him on the morals and ethics of what the child did? Do you discuss the circumstances in which it is appropriate to club a child with an iron bar?

Or you do you look at the blood in the gutter streaming from the child, punch the man, take his bar and scream "look at what you did! *Nothing* could ever justify *this*."

Do the actions of the man not forfeit his right to be engaged with respect? Does the wholly immoral and unjustifiable act not entirely remove the possibility of civilised discussion?

I tend towards the latter. You plead that the murder of children is justified because the Palestinians aren't a real people. That it's the fault of landlords and not Israel that millions of people live in an open air concentration camp. I think you're wrong for many reasons but you don't get to have this discussion while you're beating a child with an iron bar.

On a practical viewpoint, I also think it's pointless. You don't believe these things and *therefore* you support the actions of the Israeli state. You support the actions of the Israeli state and *justify* it with these things. I could prove every single word you completely untrue and it would not change your mind one inch, because these arguments are not why you support Israel. 

Think about it. Does any oppressor ever think they're wrong? Or do they always find a way to rationalise their actions?

That said, for the record, I absolutely disagree with what you say. The point on which you are most wrong is that Israel has ever offered a viable peace deal. Claiming an offer of "93% of the land" they claimed is a fundamental misunderstanding of the structure of the offer. It would not have lead to a viable state. It would not have lead to a free and independent Palestine. It would have left Palestine as a vassal state, entirely subject to Israeli economic, political and military control. It was an offer designed to be rejected for the sole purpose of allowing people like you to claim that the Palestinians rejected a peace offer. I'd say it's clever but it's the oldest trick in the book. Make an unacceptable offer and you can't lose. If they accept you win. If they refuse you win.

And your argument about the Palestinians not existing as a people prior to the arrival of Israel is dead wrong too. Are you therefore saying the land was vacant? Or that it wasn't vacant but it was OK to expel occupants because they weren't the original inhabitants? And that it's fine for Israel to do it because they were there first? Despite this being literally a thousand years before the concept of the nation state even existed?

Regardless, I could be completely wrong about this and you be completely right and it wouldn't change a damn thing while you're beating the child.  posted to submission: Israeli forces kill ten in Gaza protests as anger mounts over U.S. Embassy

[23:45:51] Comment: dyzdps0 by doUevenbro : >I assume that your observations represent individuals and their wages

Yes, to be exact my observations are the individuals and wage is one of the variables.

>You have to keep in mind that the coefficient of every explanatory variable will be estimated by keeping the other ones constant. You have to decide if you want to know the coefficients of every single explanatory variable regarding education, or if you want a single coefficient representing the quality of education. If so, you should create an index (e.g. the mean of all variables about education combined). 
Creading an index is what i chose to do, but only because i do not really have variables that directly represent the quality of the education, but i have ratings from 1-4 of students for questions about the university, and i figured it's my only way to take the mean of the results of the ratings (since the individual questions don't really mean anything). 

>Including regions that capture different levels of salary makes the whole thing a little bit more complicated. I wouldn't recommend using it without solid knowledge about regression models.  
Isn't it as simple as creating dummies for every region?
For example Europe (0/1)
America (0/1)
Africa (0/1)

and just add them to the regression?
Or even have a categorical variable "region" with 1=europe
2=america and 3=africa and just "ib1.region" to the regression?

>yes true, sorry i didn't mean to ask a stupid simple question seemingly wanting others to do the work for me. i was really desperate at that time, still am tbh. I can interpret the easier things of the OLS regression but i wasn't sure about using the OLS method. Figured maybe i will have to use something i never heard about but guess that is not going to be the case.

For now, I only took university graduates as a sample. Would you concider it good if i would do another regression with below university graduates, maybe even 2 more groups, for example a group with only mandatory school and another one who finished a vocational school/trade school. And then maybe do an ANOVA for the 3 groups?

Thank you a lot for the replies posted to submission: What regression model should i use?

[23:46:15] Comment: dyzdpsb by flandyandy : I would be curious to hear how the play tests were performed because I lean towards LeVentNoir on this, though not as strongly as they appear to feel.  This is a class that would be a blast to play, but it would be a frustrating class to have in the party as they would outshine everything that you would do.  They would be beefier, cast better spells, and be able to rumble with the monsters all while getting hit less.  And the spells would have minimal enemy resistances so while I'm trying my best and hitting 60% of the time, this super tank is pumping out damage every turn.  

My recommendation would be to indeed try to stick with a little more weakness either in the spell casting or in the requirements for the stats. posted to submission: The Bloodborne Class - A Hemomantic, CON based Half-Caster.
