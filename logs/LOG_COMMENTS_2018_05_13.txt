[15:36:40] Comment: dywoz3q by 3kool5you : I‚Äôm sure your just trolling, but I see this logic sometimes and I really don‚Äôt understand it.

A racist is someone who, at their core, dislikes people and thinks people should be treated differently based on the color of their skin, believing some people are inferior.

A PC-Tard is someone who believes many things are offensive and society is very unequal towards marginalized groups blah blah blah.

Even if you want to argue that both are obnoxious and both are dangerous depending on how radicalized they are, I feel like at least PC folks have good intentions in mind: we shouldn‚Äôt try to offend people and we should get equal ground for everyone to not hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. You can say that‚Äôs unrealistic and stupid and whatever, but the intention is at least good.

On the other hand, a racist is obviously just a shitty-intension person. They operate from a foundation of ‚Äúhate‚Äù for specific groups. The comparison just doesn‚Äôt work for me posted to submission: I wish to speak to your moderator

"What I'm going to be doing is called putting, and what I'm holding is a golf club specifically made for that, a putter. I have to hit the wall with the putter so that it can get in the hole, and I can't use anything other than the clubs, because that'd be against the rules. Now watch closely..."

*Adrianne places her right gloved-hand on the end of the club's handle with a firm grip and places her left hand over the thumb in a way that'll give her a weaker strike. Then she focuses her attention on the ball and the supposed hole, taking slow breaths as she readies herself. Her shoulders were relaxed and her knees were slightly bent.*

*She moves her club ever so slightly to the side and then gently pushes the ball with the putter as she exhales, causing the ball to roll towards the makeshift hole, coming to a stop directly on top of it.*

*Adrianne gives a bright smile and turns to Beaumont.* "It's much more satisfying when you here the sound of the ball falling into an actual hole, but that's the basics of golf. At least, for putting." *she moves over to the ball and picks it up with her left hand. She offers Beaumont her club.*

Just to add that if you have a laptop and tlp is installed, one can edit its config file to switch to performance conditional to being connected to AC. This is what I use.

>You can run a game with higher CPU and I/O priorities by running the  below command as root, replacing $user with the username of the user you  want to run the game as, and $cmd with the game you want to run:nice \-n \-10 ionice \-c 1 \-n 1 su $user \-c "$cmd"

Is there a way of making this command more straightforward? For example, to make it not require root and to add it to the Steam Set Launch Options option?

Unless you're a breeder and simultaneously manufacturer/trader of accessories, no benefit here - only costs, because you do need accessories for all the foals and yearlings before you sell them. Space, food, maintenance, training for all these horses costs not all that much less than for the "champion". The profit margin on the sale is vastly smaller because fixed cost is quite similar. If you sell 100 $10k horses, you'll earn way less than if you sell one $1mln - because despite income in both cases is $1mln, the expenditure in the former case is near hundred-fold. posted to submission: Father and son

[15:39:19] Comment: dywp1eo by DuckDuckDuckDuckDux : 
One track which I don't like that much is the "silly track" from XC2, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xVUX7Q9mvI, which plays durning silly moments and first plays durning Poppi's creation scene. I don't like it at all. Mainly because I just don't like how it sounds, but also because it tries to mimic a track from XC1 way too much, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTR2MlYdaPY. Some things I think made that track (Riki's theme) and even a track from X which had a nopon theme (Tatsu's theme, or whatever it's called) both just sounded more interesting. XC1 had funny and memorable dialog and scenes that went along and matched with it, "**I WANT A MILLION PRESS-UPS FROM BOTH OF YOU, AND YOU BETTER NOT STOP UNTIL YOUR BISEPS EXPLODE!!!!!** while X's sounded very unique to it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmN4txCbugs  (I know people might hate it because of some certain overused running jokes in the game but it's funky nonetheless).

Everything may fuck up and you can't follow through with that, don't fret, make a new one and go for it. 

Source: at 16 wanted to be a naval architect. Did short courses, visited unis in the states (am from London).
Drug addictions got out of hand and dropped out of school at 17. Went to a college the next year to study fashion because my mum said "you like clothes, give fashion a go"

I had nothing to lose so thought why not. Did the course for 1 year, currently a fashion student at what is regarded as the best in the world for it. 

Am I a naval architect, no.
Do I want to be, fuck no.
I didn't plan any of this but it's all good and there's no point regretting shit.

Have fun and just do things

[15:40:32] Comment: dywp4as by Centaurious : if you‚Äôre super terrified to the point it impacts a lot you should try the cup (but avoid the Diva Cup). 

basically it‚Äôs a little cup you put up there, you remove it and empty it about 3-4 times a day. if you‚Äôre not squeamish about your own blood it‚Äôs honestly really nice. 

i just dump mine and then wipe it mostly clean with some toilet paper, and maybe rinse it out in the sink if it‚Äôs close enough to the toilet. i also wear pads with it, about to switch to reusable pads to save money and help with environment. sometimes it leaks if i don‚Äôt put it in properly but otherwise it‚Äôs just like a tampon- only leaks when it‚Äôs too full. 

the risk of TSS is extremely minimal, and i like mine a lot. saves having to buy a new box of tampons and pads every month or so :)

[15:40:49] Comment: dywp4b2 by TyIzaeL : I use UniFi at home and hope to use it at work eventually. The killer wireless feature offered by my 7 years-old Cisco wireless is [Dynamic Channel Assignment](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-3/b_RRM_White_Paper/b_RRM_White_Paper_chapter_0100.html). Every interval the controller will evaluate how to best assign channels to all of the APs in the building in order to avoid interference as much as possible. Sure the UniFi APs have auto assign, but from what I've seen it's AP-based and they only evaluate what channel to pick at boot.

On the switching side, UniFi switches don't do [QoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service). This is important for orgs who depend on VOIP phones. posted to submission: Who are the main competitors to Ubiquiti?
[15:40:51] Comment: dywp4b3 by Cursedmumm : Personally I've build her as a very quick paradox engine combo deck, abusing fast mana, tutoring and draw spells in the spirit of vintage paradoxical outcome decks (which is an all star in the build).

I don't necessarily cast her every game but the ability to recur a destroyed paradox engine, memory jar or even just a mana rock coupled with her tap ability that allows you to keep going with the engine (you cast the card) really made her the perfect fit. 

So if you are in too more competitive decks she fits great in that list. Otherwise I second going for antiquity war shenanigans.  posted to submission: How in the world do you build Rona, Disciple of Gix

[15:41:17] Comment: dywp4bc by Jafars_Car_Insurance : The man has a right to free speech, and in general (although it really depends on what precisely he said) whatever he was doing was probably completely legal, if also morally repugnant. Spitting at people, however, is not legal. It is a felony. So what the man did was unpleasant certainly, but both women were acting illegally and trying to cause him deliberate harm, so in a court of law, any violent action he took would almost certainly be judged to be self-defence. In that sense, the man is completely within his rights to be doing what he was doing (unless he was causing a really very big scene) and both women should, by law, be arrested. posted to submission: Social Justice Warrior takedown

[15:43:55] Comment: dywp4d5 by Winters_Wolves_ : Thanks for replying on a weekend. I sincerely hope there will be significant compensation for players that did not exploit this glitch to even the playing field. Some players have invested real money in their accounts and this glitch devalues all of their progress, grinding and money. How this is handled has the potential to damage the game even further if your long time players/supporters leave due to feeling insulted or undermined. I would suggest awarding at least 1 fragment of each fighter in those events (3 star and 4 star), I believe that a full fighter would be overkill but fragments of each is fair and would not upset balance. I hope this is handled with utmost care and respect. posted to submission: Devs long time no clarity

[15:44:03] Comment: dywpary by Gizortnik : >That anything *regardless how small* is reported, logged and passed to the appropriate authorities.

Right, so that the authorities can continue to build up evidence against the parents. Because *that's their fucking job*.

>anything regardless how innocent it may seem needs to be reported in case its a warning sign or a small part of something more serious. Thats all i think this is.

That's *exactly* the problem. Reporting *everything* to the authorities means that the kids and parents are going to be routinely investigated by the police for criminal activity. One of these days, they'll find something, and someone's going to prison.

> A few flags triggering an investigation, which will i'm assuming find no wrong doings. and meeting at the school is pretty mild, if there was some serious concerns they would have gone to the persons home with child services.

Those are idiotic assumptions. Investigations *look* for wrong doing. That's the point. Finding no wrong doing is the result of the authorities *failing to find wrong doing*. It is *not* the result of there not being any. It's the same legal principle as to why people who are acquitted in trials are "not guilty" rather than "innocent". The meeting is a way to see if the parents are willing to incriminate themselves in a crime, and also serve as a warning to deter future "suspicious" activities. 

The reason they didn't go to the home with child services is because they didn't have enough evidence to allow them to do so. They would have if they could. This is *always* true. 

The legal system is built off of conflict. The legal system does not find truth, it finds blame that is the closest reflection of truth that the court can manage to agree upon. The moment the authorities are contacted in reference to particular people, whether you believe it or not, you are asking the state to blame someone for violating public order.

Now, this is different from my original comment, but it's not better. posted to submission: "a man at the Freedom March last Sun took his children for a day out.

It would have made more sense to simply state that they're promising improvements, as it's more in line with what was said.

And dropping them is still a possible option. They might drop them from the next beta until a model that they feel has offered significant enough improvements is available.

[15:46:34] Comment: dywpau4 by Fishgottaswim78 : > But isn't "I am into you, are you into me? No? Next!!" Exactly the opposite to "just being open and fighting for what you want in a relationship"

It can be. I'll be more specific. About 6 months into our relationship I was really falling in love with my partner, and I thought he was too. One night out of nowhere he came to me in tears because he wanted to break up. His reason was that he worried we were too different to stay together over the long term. I loved him and I *strongly* disagreed with him (I have an "opposites attract" philosophy I guess) and so I told him that. I told him *my* perspective on our relationship, that our differences made us stronger and that I believed we were the same in the stuff that *really* mattered and so I begged him to reconsider. 

Now, it turns out he did and the rest is history, but he could have gone home and thought about it and arrived at a completely different conclusion. I did everything I could that night to change his mind, but ultimately the decision to stay was his, and if he had chosen to walk away I would have had to respect that. 

That's what I mean. Relationships and dating are about striving (maybe this is a better word than fighting) with integrity for what you want and advocating for yourself to the best of your abilities, but it ALSO means respecting and accepting that there is another person who needs to do the same thing. Like you thought when you were little, BOTH people have to agree. Being in a relationship then becomes about agreeing *every day* to be in a relationship, does that make sense? That's what love is: it's a choice that *two* people have to make independently to be together. 

> I just believe if you like her as a girlfriend, you like her as a friend

I agree with you completely!

> legitimate to try to attract someone/to put them in the mood? 

i think so. if i want to get my boyfriend in the mood I might cook him a nice dinner or light some candles and put on some good music. maybe that's a little manipulative, but I think it's fairly harmless and generally socially acceptable. But I think the crucial distinction between this and a PUA tactic is that I'm aware that it might work, but he also might just *not* want to have sex that night, and I can respect that. Ultimately that's what makes PUAs toxic: it's not the games (many of which are dumb in and of themselves), it's the fact that the games are built on the idea that a woman is going to say no and that that no doesn't matter at all. 

> like I can be abandoned at anytime because nothing and trying to "negotiate" that situation is not accepting the no.

Look. If you were up for a job that you really wanted, you would try everything to get it, right? And maybe if the people who were supposed to give you a job said no, you might strive to change their minds, right? But at some point you would stop, right? You wouldn't just show up to that workplace *anyway* and take a desk, right? because that would be weird and creepy.

it's the same thing. you're allowed to advocate for yourself, but you know that there's a line somewhere that changes from person to person when it goes from advocating to pushing. also there's this: if you have to have an hour-long debate to get someone to sleep with you, is it *worth* it? You want someone to fuck you because they WANT to fuck you, not cuz you talked them into it. You want someone to hire you because they WANT you to work with them, not because you were so pushy they thought it'd be easier to give you what you want than go away?

It's a balance. Some people are naturally more pushy than others, and they spend their entire lives learning to ease off and listen to people more. Other people never really learn how to advocate for themselves and spent their entire lives trying to speak up for what they want. Everyone else is somewhere in the middle and it's about learning how to find the balance between demanding what you want and acquiescing to others needs. even when you find a partner that wants you just as much as you want them, there will ALWAYS be a negotiation between you because you are still two separate people who's needs may intersect but are not exactly the same. 

> I try to flirt and suddenly the mood is lost, can I or cannot I try getting the situation back on track?

You can definitely try. If you find that the trying isn't changing anything, then at some point you gotta throw in the towel. 

What you can't do is let the possibility of failure get in the way of even trying in the first place. You're going to fail. You're probably going to fail more times that you succeed. But those failures are STILL valuable because they are learning experiences (and, frequently: great stories!) and because there is TREMENDOUS value in putting yourself out there regardless of the outcome.

[15:46:52] Comment: dywpauc by ladypalpatine : I feel like I didn't give enough background.

My mother is a narcissist. This is a sliver of an argument that went on yesterday about dinner for tonight. She wanted to have pot roast, I don't like that, and said I would rather have something else. She scoffed at me, my dad capitulated, and the issue was declared over.

I decided for once to stand up for myself because I never do, in any of these situations, because I get shot down if I do .

I know this seems like it's not a big deal, but it's coming on the tail end of me finally speaking up about my sister basically getting away with doing nothing around the house while I'm made to feel guilty and called a princess sarcastically if I don't do it all. 

What she's saying with this is "it's about what I want".

Sorry for not giving any background but given the circumstances I'm not taking this the wrong way. posted to submission: I'm apparently not a mother? My motherhood is less valid. No wonder I ended up with this disorder

I've heard that TheDamian has always done great presentations but I've only gotten to see some in recent years via online videos.

Imo the one I just linked from 2016 and ["Three Little Words" from 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob6YHpcXmTg&list=PLRuESFRW2Fa77XObvk7-BYVFwobZHdXdK&index=27&t=0s) are both masterpieces.

Among the wonderfully varied styles used by Perl presenters I particularly love Larry's fearlessly authentic and predictably unpredictable infinite-layers-of-meaning style and jnthn's genial genius for wielding occam's razor in all things including his presentations. But imo TheDamian really is in a class of his own as a presenter.

PS. If you generally like video presentations as a way of absorbing info and are interested in P6, [the Perl 6 (English) videos collection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRuESFRW2Fa77XObvk7-BYVFwobZHdXdK&disable_polymer=true) has 180 that are at least watchable including the two I just linked above (the collection includes a few that are arguably only tangentially about Perl 6 such as "Three Little Words"). posted to submission: Looking at the Lispy side of Perl

**TL;DR:** there's a 100-year cycle which determines what happens if a ruler dies without an heir. Certain events shift the cycle a certain number of years forward or backward, so different countries are on different points of the cycle.

* 75 years on the cycle: RM dynasty spread, PU possible if dynasty already spread
* 20 years on the cycle: PU if there's a country with RM, same dynasty or both
* **5 years on the cycle (this happened to you)**: if the inherited country has 15 or less provinces and another country with the same dynasty (which you had, since Muscovy and Ryazan both start with a Rurikovich) has at least double their provinces, they get inherited instantly

**TL;DR:TL;DR:** you got lucky and won a 1/20 diceroll to instantly inherit a smaller country with the same dynasty. posted to submission: Insta-Inherit Ryazan moments before popping their drilling army in 2nd war vs Novgorod

[15:52:51] Comment: dywpo7k by KnowingSmile :   I originally bought in at around 3 cents. Watched it hit 29-36, watched it plummet day by day. It was a long term strategy for me. Where it's at now still aligns where I think it will be headed. It doesn't have to be 30 cents today or tomorrow, but in the future with another popular rise in crypto.

Now the people that bought the ATH, they were on a FOMO train wreck waiting to happen. Normally for a short term investment you should dip out before you take a 20% loss, which I hope they were able to do. You also might have become hesitant with the 2018 US tax change laws.

I feel like it will be harder to reach the ridiculous spurt ATH a second time as quickly with how so many people got burned on the FOMO, for a while it built a notorious reputation.

For myself I set a price point and time to enter and exit. I'll be sticking to it unless information comes up that changes my opinion. I don't mind if I exit before an ATH, I am happy with the gains I've made(will make). posted to submission: ATH HODLers

[15:54:45] Comment: dywpo9c by sdbest : An odd op\-ed, indeed. What the writer,  Gerard Alexander, an associate professor of politics at the University of Virginia, seems to be arguing is, 'yes, Liberals you are much smarter than Conservatives and all you say about Conservatives is true, but, please, don't be so blatant and aggressive about it because you'll offend the Conservatives and they'll just do more of their bad shit.' He's also saying, 'let the Conservatives do some of their bad shit so that Liberals can win on the bigger issues.'

Now riddle me this. How do Liberals control themselves and other Liberals to achieve what the good professor is recommending? Do we feign ignorance, racism, misogyny, bigotry, and climate change denial around Conservatives, so as not to offend them? posted to submission: Liberals, You‚Äôre Not as Smart as You Think

[15:54:56] Comment: dywpo9i by supers0nic : I would not recommend Raiz if you only have $500. You need $5000 for the fees decrease to 0.275% p.a (not including ETF fees). Ideally you should have $5000 because at that point the fees are the lowest. 

Look at [this](http://thewealthguy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acorns-Total-Fee-Under-5k.png) chart. The fees will be about 3% of your account if you only have $500 in it. 

I would recommend with going the high interest savings account route, as mentioned UBank is good (I've been with them since 2012). I've also been using Acorns (now Raiz) since it launched in Australia, but I have more than $5000 in my account. 

A term deposit could also be an option, but from what I've seen the rates are usually lower than online banks, but that's because the banks may lower their rates whereas the term deposit rate is locked in for the period. posted to submission: Teenager with $500 cash advice

[15:56:34] Comment: dywpth3 by vertical_punch : I think you are missing some things when you watch mma and competitive grappling.   *"Clinches that tie you up too long"*  are a function of two things.  

* Both people are good grapplers and there is an invisible war or micro offensive and defensive positioning and set ups going on
* Deliberately holding to prevent effective strikes

If there is a skill disparity, ie, a trained grappler vs anyone else, that clinch will be a throw instantly.   Also, tying up with someone to prevent their strikes is fine since you are preventing their strikes and you can use them as a shield.  

Leaving the striking stuff out since I cant speak to them.

If you can do a low takedown like an ankle\-pick, that probably means you are more than good enough as a wrestler to do higher level take downs \(singles and doubles, high crotch\) and wouldnt bother with a low take down on anyone other than another competitive wrestler.  

I feel there is a misconception in the self\-defense/RBSD crowd that is someone can do a berimbolo that they would only do berimbolos or similar niche moves.   What this misses is that if someone is good enough to do a berimbolo in competition, they are an absolute monster in bjj and could own an untrained person trivially with the basics.   posted to submission: /u/Kintanon Shows Leadership And Asks The Real Questions (Reposting so I can write a proper response)

[15:57:06] Comment: dywpthj by ffxivmorningstatic : **TL:DW QoL Improvements:**

* Refilling energy while in a game mode shouldn't return you to the home screen.
* Using a Friend's champion should spread the experience to other champions during adventuring to incentivize actually using others' champions.  Right now, using a personal farmer/friend's champion has no difference in EXP earned.
* The ability to change out which Champions are being used in Adventures/Raids without having to return to the Adventure screen or Raid screen.
* Training or Promoting should allow the user to change between Champions while feeding units.
* Login rewards are lack luster (and I have to agree.  SW just reworked theirs and these look like a joke now).  
* Social functions are underwhelming for a Massive Multiplayer game.  No ability to whisper, no control of chat channels, no ability to block a player's chat.

**Pros to DHC**

* The interactivity between the game developers' and the community is huge.  They are active in their own discord discussing the game with the players.
* Ad system benefits both the players and the devs.  Incredibly smart move.
* Theory-crafting is a lot easier because of the statistics tab.
* Auto-Lock is a great feature.
* The amount of content on launch is fantastic on launch.  (I just hope they prove to continually release content and not stagnant like other competitors). posted to submission: Top Improvements and Implementations in Game

[15:57:13] Comment: dywpthm by CriticalGameMastery : Thanks for your post and I want you to know you are not the only one struggling with this.

I do a few things:

1) Diet Control: This may be blasphemy but if you‚Äôre struggling with keeping energy then I‚Äôd recommend trying to cut all pop/soda, caffeinated drinks, and energy drinks from your diet entirely. Bottom line is that stuff kills or inhibits your body‚Äôs ability to regulate its own energy. I‚Äôm no doctor but I say give it a shot for a month a month and evaluate how you feel. If you already do this then try to cut out all fast food and fried food (as reasonably as you can). Like I said, try it for a month and evaluate how you feel.

2) Sleep: Be sure to get a good nights sleep on the day you are running your game. Don‚Äôt stay up late preparing, playing video games, or fiff faffing. Sometimes it‚Äôs unavoidable to have to stay up or get little sleep, just do what you can.

3) Prepare: Do all your preparations before the day of your game so you can spend your day and time mentally preparing for the event. I like to make checklists to minimize the mental load of trying to remember a million things.

4) Meditation: It may sound hokey but I am a sales coach in a call center and I teach all my team members meditation techniques to focus their mind so they can have tools to help cope with stress. Stress not only limits performance but it also reduces energy and desire for success. Download the Headspace app and take a few minutes every day to follow a meditation there. Most the stuff is free but you can support it with money to buy additional content if you do choose.

5) Track Your Progress: What works for you doesn‚Äôt work for everyone else and visa versa. Find what works and stick to it and if you try something for a month and it doesn‚Äôt help then don‚Äôt bother doing it. posted to submission: What are some ways to deal with getting tired while running games?

[15:58:08] Comment: dywptii by EndOfNothing : Lol. 'Grow up' because you disagree with the way I want to pass it (which implies I don't want to, incorrectly, which seem to be a fair few of the responses to me because people can't deal with nuance). Some of us have to live with the ramifications of the precedent you want to set. Take that tool away from the DUP and pass it. I'd quite like a referendum because the DUP wouldn't have a hope in hell of ever changing it back after the masses have voted. posted to submission: Tories block bid to bring equal marriage to Northern Ireland

[15:58:11] Comment: dywptil by Audacious531 : My brothers and I went out to a total dive bar with some friends. I discovered that I really like strawberry daiquiris but don't actually appreciate being drunk (I only had a few drinks but I was on meds that accentuated the effect). It's not bad, but it's not particularly enjoyable for me either.

My older brother decided he should be the dictionary definition for binge drinking, and my younger brother had like 2 drinks. Afterwards we went to a friend's house and discussed politics and philosophy. (IIRC the friend was a bit of a dumbass and tried to explain with "science" how the sun is sentient.).  posted to submission: What did you do for your 21st birthday?

[15:58:18] Comment: dywptio by YouKnewHere : And they award different rewards. Each time a game is introduced, the costs are clearly on each button. Not sure how it‚Äôs sneaky to have a different cost for different rewards. It‚Äôs not like one hour the Spectre reset cost 75k and the next hour it cost 150k. Just yesterday the complaints were that the full game was too expensive and people started learning about resetting. Today it seems they look into resets and find out the costs vary, which is now a complaint. Crazy. My currency hasn‚Äôt been devalued, I‚Äôm actually increasing the value I get out of my currency, and spending a brand new earned currency to get additional value.

But currently I like the Galahad as an energy shield counter, since at my level energy shield bots usually use Thunders or plasma weapons, which are easily tanked by the Galahad.

[15:59:40] Comment: dywpy44 by RitersBloque : Not really. As ironic as it sounds for Tracy who did time, he really doesn't face many consequences for his actions outside of jail. He steals shoes, mooches at Al's, nearly injures a college girl, starts a fight that forces the crew to run, steals a gun andgets challenged to a fight by a clearly overmatched opponent in Earn (which he easily wins). The worst thing to happen to him is not being in on the trio moving and being left out. Even then, he has food and a woman with him. Plus, it looks like he's going to climb in any way, eat and get some. If we never see him again, he'll find a way to get by until he gets in trouble again.  posted to submission: Does anyone else thinks in the finale got Tracy what he deserved ?

[16:00:27] Comment: dywpy4q by M4r00n : Simple. Because the -real- information is intentionally obscured by Hirez, hence people take what information they can get, even innaccurate, to have as a basis for their oppinion.

It's -the- reason why transparency is important, to prevent frustration and speculation. That a company in 2018 does not understand this is mind-boggling.

[16:00:44] Comment: dywpy4y by LID919 : Are you talking about where I wrote this?

> If it was explicitly written in "Alessia Ottus' Guide to Kvatch" that "Castle Kvatch towers over the landscape, the grandest structure in the Imperial skyline. Second only the the White Gold Tower." Then yes, having it be just a small keep would be disappointing. But given that the only thing you are complaining about is a 200 year old subjective experience of a single character, I don't see the big deal.

Did you not notice the "If" at the beginning of the sentence? You might want to work on your reading comprehension.

"Guide to Kavatch" doesn't exist. I was giving an example of when the Beyond Skyrim devs *should* care about the size of a castle for contrast.

There is **no** written lore about the size of Castle Kvatch. Hence, it can be whatever size they damn well please that still makes sense for the architecture of the area. posted to submission: Picture of Kvatch Castle Exterior. Curtesy of firenight487‚Äôs Stream

[16:01:57] Comment: dywpy5h by TheStudliestMuffin : I started smoking cigarettes I'm 4th grade, which turned to weed in 6th, coke by 10th. This may seem like shit advice but I got off coke by turning my addiction elsewhere, back to weed now that I'm a junior in a prestigious college (somehow), I had to find another addiction to replace my reward complex. This has recently taken the form of being a douchey gym-rat, but my head is clearer now.

Replacing an addiction with another is what worked for me, but it's also the most dangerous thing about drugs (depending on the direction you're headed). posted to submission: Finding it hard to relate need older advice

[16:02:17] Comment: dywq43m by roy_fatty : My mother in law‚Äôs husband left her 3 years ago after he was caught fucking another woman at work and got fired

They were married for 37+ years and she is the most helpless person I‚Äôve ever met, hands down. At one point she had to be taught how to pump gas because she had essentially never done it for herself.

My wife is 100% responsible for taking care of her mother, and my father in law knows this - most days I feel like I have a sister in law who is a complete emotional wreck instead of a MIL.

I can‚Äôt prove it, but it appears that my father in law hid money from her (which wouldn‚Äôt be too hard, considering she didn‚Äôt know how to do anything for her entire life) and shortly after the divorce was finalized (no fault state) he had a new house, new wife, new Jeep, and everything was chill. After about a year he got tired of the Jeep and got a new Mercedes SLS instead.

My mother in law was left with a 2007 Chevy Tahoe that she can barely drive, an ancient home with a myriad of problems that she refuses to address (sewer, drainage, appliances breaking left and right and the remaining ones are ancient)

She was helped to find  a job by her ex father in law and now makes about $24k per year

I know that in some states this idea of red pill women ruin your life men‚Äôs rights bullshit is an issue, but to hear it constantly being spouted every SINGLE time someone tries to discuss the plight of older or somewhat helpless women in divorce is pretty exhausting.

I really wish that was how things were everywhere all the time (as men‚Äôs rights proponents will have us believe) because if it was my wife and I wouldn‚Äôt have had to spend the last 2 days dealing with her miserable sad sack mother who literally has suggested that she may not want to live to be elderly if she has to be alone, regardless of our amazing 4 year old daughter who she loves more than anything. She won‚Äôt help herself and we can‚Äôt do any more for her and she is bringing us down.

Also even gold is 1000 sr away from what I'm talking about so it's probably still a little better off than how things are even lower. And coaching people with a lower skill set still avoids all the real problems out there. You probably had a good stack (5 or 6?) That were all actively communicating whether it was because of you or not. The problem is when people don't communicate. Which is all the time in bronze. Just be aware that the way you are experiencing the game is far different than the people you criticize for complaining. It seems to me there is a lot of frustration and headache that you have avoided due to prior experience with competitive shooters.  posted to submission: How to improve: Personal accountability and the white belt mentality.

Carlisle was an accident imo and no worries there. The bump is slightly more concerning but I still feel like he should be ok. Reason being initial contact was shoulder to shoulder and Ross's head whipped forward causing the head clash. Plus he got up and played on afterwards.

[16:06:22] Comment: dywq92d by RangerPretzel : Honestly, I'm not surprised that you doubt the movie "The Magic Pill". It does seem unbelievable and seems to run contrary to everything we've been taught about nutrition since the 1970s.

You're going to have to see for yourself, though. And of course, it's difficult in your position. You've just had a heart attack and a stent put in and the last thing you want to do is make it worse.

Understanding nutrition and how it can lead to heart disease, T2D, hypertension, and other ailments is rather complicated, but it is primarily drive by something called "insulin resistance". It doesn't develop overnight, but over decades of elevated blood sugar (and by proxy, elevated insulin) levels.  

This is the root cause of those diseases: **insulin resistance**.

Low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) including Keto, Paleo, Primal, Atkins, etc. seek to *reverse* insulin resistance by dramatically lowering your carbohydrate intake. This dramatically lowered carbohydrate intake consistently lowers your insulin levels. And as such, over time, your body's cells become more sensitive to insulin again. At the same time, your body is switching over to fat and a derivation of fat known as "ketones" as a primary fuel.

> but I can't wrap my brain that it's a cleaner fuel.

Carbohydrate burning in your body is inherently stressful. It's fast energy, no doubt! But it creates lots of oxidative stress and free radicals.

Fat (and ketone) burning in the body is relatively "clean" (low stress) and produces very few free radicals.

This page explains it pretty well: https://betterbodychemistry.com/oxidative-stress/eating-fat-oxidative-stress-problem/

> so it stands to reason that our diets back then probably weren't very good for us.

Our diets were probably optimal around the 1700 and 1800s. We had a fairly modern agrarian society, but we didn't have artificially processed and packaged foods. The foods were still whole and we had to cook the food ourselves. Fruit was not regular or common (or bred to be oversized and oversweet like it is today.) Even refined sugar wasn't super common. Grain was only available during the harvest season. And we didn't use heavily processed oils (seed oils), but whatever was naturally occurring. And we all worked pretty hard (burning lots of energy), rather than living sedentary lives.

People still died young, but almost never of T2D or heart attacks. They died of viral and bacterial infections. 

I think the reason why the Aborigines were introduced in the film was to demonstrate a human culture where the people were generally robust and healthy and never had any modern amenities (in contrast to Europeans whom were advancing their culture rapidly from the 1500s thru the 2000s.) And then suddenly were dragged from their primitive society into the 20th century and fed 20th century food and very soon started becoming sickly. (T2D, heart disease.) It still takes a decade or two.

And you can point out that, "hey, it takes a decade or two or three to get heart disease from eating a high-carbohydrate diet... Are you sure it's really this?" Well, you can say the same thing about smoking. It takes a decade or two or three to get lung cancer from smoking... Does anyone really doubt that smoking causes cancer?

>  there's not really any hard evidence that I have found to support the notion that coconut oil and lard in copious amounts will lower cholesterol and mitigate heart disease.

Cholesterol is a bit of red herring and a boogie man. It's not actually a problem for 80% of the population. People with the APOE4 variant of a gene are at risk for heart disease, but cholesterol itself isn't the root cause. It's just a passenger, not the driver, in the disease process. (Thus a red herring.)

Coconut oil and lard in copious amounts along with a high carbohydrate diet definitely will NOT reverse mitigate heart disease.

When one removes the carbohydrates from the diet and gets the body to fully switch over to a "fat adapted" mode where 70 - 80% of your calories comes from fat (either dietary or stored fat), the diseases reverse course.

There are a lot of videos and books I can point you at. I don't know how technical or scientific you are, so I'm not sure what to recommend.

I like these videos:

[Cholesterol - When to Worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyzPEii-wo0)

[Cholesterol Conundrum and the Root Cause solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuj6nxCDBZ0)
(This one is long and you may want to watch at 1.5x)

Here's a playlist of LCHF videos that you can peruse: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoo6RhS9OGerJms7lVK6oDS9AwiH3NV92

Some are more accessible than others. They're all pretty interesting.

[16:06:32] Comment: dywq92m by jachildress25 : The problem with your hypothetical example is twofold. Firstly, you used a small, $500 amount, so the $12 in interest isn‚Äôt that significant in a vacuum. The problem is that if one really doesn‚Äôt possess the discipline to wait 3 months to save the money for a small, $500 purchase, then that person is very likely to start sliding down the slippery slope of rationalizing the same method for a larger purchase where the interest does become significant. 

Also, a plan to pay off a balance in 3 months can be thrown a curveball by life. A broken down car, medical emergency, etc. can leave one only paying the minimum balance on your credit card. Do that for too long, and suddenly one‚Äôs minimum payment isn‚Äôt even reducing the principal, but only covering interest.  Eventually, your monthly payment isn‚Äôt even reducing your balance.

It should be said that they only seem to care about GDP growth. Not about median incomes or inequality or things like that.

On the bottom half you go wall, wall
You want to aim almost in the center of them all so you don't have to move it too much and fluster yourself. 
Be careful though, while getting use to this you will throw walls on the top of your stairs and that's gonna snuff your push right there. posted to submission: How do I build double stairs with walls on them?

[16:07:31] Comment: dywq93k by HopDoc : As a medical student on internal medicine, I had to go see a consult in the ED. When asking the ED doc what the consult was for, he told me, "just come down and see". Great.

Walked into a clearly schizophrenic patient who was acutely psychotic. It was strange that they were trying to admit them to medicine, so I looked through his chart and noticed he has a white count and was febrile (indicating infection). I then proceeded with my physical exam.

As I was listening to his heart and lungs he lifted his gown up and exposed his penis...at least what was left of his penis. The guy cut the end of his penis off. Based on how it looked, he probably cut it off 2-3 days ago and it was already looking infected. He kept on digging his fingers into all the puss on the outside of it and trying to explain to me that he was pulling out these hair-thin worms.

Needless to say, I did not go into internal medicine or psych. posted to submission: Doctors of Reddit, what is the most "how the fuck did that happen to you" case you've seen?

[16:07:39] Comment: dywq93p by DrHugh : It helps to have an understanding of love.

We tend to overload the word "love." We use it for different things:

* I love my wife.
* I love pizza.
* I love gardening.
* I love my kids.

Clearly I don't love my wife the same way I love my kids. And I certainly don't love pizza the same way I love my wife! So we're a bit sloppy with the word "love," and what we mean by it.

The early excitement in a new relationship, which many people call "**falling in love**" or "New Relationship Energy" \(NRE\), is primarily sexual attraction. It is infatuation, a biological process. We can't choose with whom to have it; in fact, we can experience it with someone we haven't met, or someone who is clearly unsuitable for us. We also can't choose to feel it with someone we'd like to have a relationship with.

This "in love" feeling fades. It is temporary. It is fun while it lasts, especially when reciprocated. But it does overwhelm our thoughts, and tends to blind us to the realities of a partner's flaws. Because we enjoy the "in love" feeling, we like the person who is the object of it; but we are only looking at our side of things.

**True love** is a choice. It is a decision to have our partner feel loved. That probably means we want them to feel valued, comforted, encouraged, supported, appreciated, respected, etc. Those things don't happen spontaneously; if you want a partner to feel respected, you have to decide to act in a way that conveys that.

It should be clear how the love for a partner and the love for a child are similar by this definition.

It should also be clear that you make a conscious choice to add someone to your circle of loved people. Whether this is having a new child or a new partner or just a new friend, it is your decision.

When my wife was pregnant with our second child, one of the things the parents\-again class we had to take covered was the idea of comparing love to a candle flame. It is not diminished by lighting another candle. It is a nice image, but it was designed for small children who will soon have a new sibling.

For adults, it is more a matter of understanding much time you have to give those you love the attention they deserve. Again, a conscious choice.

If your view of polyamory is that it allows you to have multiple sexual relationships with friends, then you probably aren't terribly concerned about love.

If, instead, you see polyamory as a way to have more than one life\-partner, people with whom you share love, then it matters very much. Having one partner like this is obviously do\-able; having twenty is probably spreading yourself too thin! You get to decide.

But there's no reason why you can't find someone with whom you want to share the legal benefits of marriage, and still keep other partners you have. Let me give you an example.

A couple of friends of mine are poly. They both came to the relationship with existing life partners. In his case, his girlfriend was his best friend, but they didn't share kink interests; they still enjoyed the sharing of sexual intimacy, and the assurance of a lifelong friend. In her case, she had a lifelong boyfriend and poly partner whom she was clear she wasn't giving up, but it was an LDR. So this couple met, dated, and eventually got married. His girlfriend ended up being his "best woman," and her boyfriend was her "man of honor." The wedding pictures were very cute if you knew the true relationships!

So you can assure your parents that you aren't closed\-off to the idea of marriage, but your head and heart are big enough to give more than one person the love and attention you'd want. posted to submission: Young poly people: how do you fight occasional insecurities about being poly?

His pension fund lost 13% first year, then 12% year after, and 10% after that all taking admin fees. then when he could start taking a pension he had to buy really expensive annuities which gobbled up the rest. The screwed up this too and gave him uneven payments throughout the year. He got left with basically nothing and all the financial ombudsman could say was ‚Äúnothing we can do‚Äù.

[16:09:38] Comment: dywqdpv by SliqRik : I honestly think it was David not only seeing, but actually testing out those other lives.  He lived out all of his possibilities and then chose to live in the "real" timeline where everything we've seen in the show happens.  It seemed like he rejected each reality for a different reason, some having to do with how he ended up, some having to do with the deterioration of his relationship with Amy or how his continued dependence crippled her life, one because he became Farouk, and one that (to me anyway) was the most bitter to watch, that being the happy home life.  I think this version is a David who was never plagued by Farouk at all, it separated at the earliest possible branch from his life and was therefore the furthest away from his reality.  It was a happy life, yes, but one that was entirely alien to him.  It was devoid of any familiar faces, and there was not even a mention of Amy.  I'd guess he left that life because he just couldn't see anything of himself in it.  That's truly tragic.  David really believes he can't have and doesn't deserve happiness. posted to submission: Post Episode Discussion: S02E06 - "Chapter 14"

btw, you're joking about eating as ethically as possible, by insinuating that I don't know what you consume, you said it yourself you eat meat lmao. to seriously give an answer to your joke, filter feeding is extremely unrealistic, living as ethically as you can by avoiding animal products, recycling, not using your car as much and plenty of other things that are realistic, are all things you're able to do on a day to day basis and will take time to get used to but will immensely help you live a more ethical lifestyle than you did before, god your argument is so flawed.

[16:11:13] Comment: dywqdqi by GracetheWorld : Yes, your hunger will change over time. Just roll with it. Don't force yourself to eat when not hungry, but at the same time try to be mindful of your calories on days when you are hungrier.

When I'm running low on calories, but still want a large filling meal, I go for scrambled eggs with veggies. I sautee whatever veggies I have on hand (spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, bell pepper and scramble 2 eggs and 3 egg whites with it. It makes huge pile of food, and clocks around 250-280 calories, that depends on what veggies you put in it.

If you are prone to snacking, make your snacks more filling, higher volume or loaded with protein. When I'm snacky, but don't want to spend all of my calories on snacks, I'll go for either of these snacks:
- huge bowl of popcorn (I get the Big Cheeze brand in Walmart, the cheese flavor has 120 calories per bag)
- chopped tomatoes with cottage cheese. Again, it's about 150 calories and it's a huge amount of food!
- cup of Greek yogurt with sugar free cheesecake jello mix (about 1/4 of the bag) with chopped strawberries is a huge and very filling snack/meal for about 200 calories
- sliced cucumber/bell pepper/carrots with half a cup of Greek yogurt with ranch seasoning is great and only about 120 calories posted to submission: Two Questions for You All

[16:11:27] Comment: dywqju8 by howtocleanyourpots : I've been hearing this garbage all my life. I remember fighting my English teacher in high school to be able to use Dune as a "real" book. It wasn't considered "real" because it was that "trash" sci-fi. Nowadays, snobs call it "genre fiction" and turn up their noses at it just the same. In an era where reading is on the decline in favor of social media and other distractions, I'd rather see people reading Harry Potter - if nothing else, it shows they have an attention span longer than 140 characters.

I've tried to read a lot of "the classics". Honestly, a lot of them are boring as hell. Perhaps they were earth shattering when they came out and made a big splash relative to the culture at the time, but without someone explaining all the historical context first, the book is just dull. It's kind of like explaining why a joke is funny.

Same for movies, or "film". Sometimes I might want to watch a "film", other times I want to sit back and watch stuff explode on screen in a mindless summer blockbuster. So what. I get in different moods and pick entertainment as such.

I will note that I do attempt to read various genres and books. I will try something "chewier" from time to time. There have been some pleasant surprises, like "The Meditations". I'm not going to shit all over someone else's reading choices, though. Everyone can do whatever they want with their free time, I'm not going to judge them for it. posted to submission: People should be encouraged to read real books.

[16:11:30] Comment: dywqjua by TheMythof_Feminism : > Who's going to enforce them?

I'm not familiar with the precise details of how the executive, legislative and judicial branch are split in the U.S. , but in Mexico the judicial branch can take captive anyone in violation of the higher laws of the republic.

And by anyone I mean anyone, even those protected by the concept of "Fuero" (Prosecutorial immunity) are not protected from the "Judiciales" which can literally break down anyone's door and take them prisoner for as long as they see fit.

You'd think these guys who effectively wield unlimited power  would be insanely corrupt in a nation as corrupt as Mexico, but they're not, they're more often than not, the most honest part of our government.

>, the judge of the court of first instance was no doubt picked for the job, but when it was appealed to our middle level of Federal courts, the appeals judges were scathing in their criticism of that judge, and removed him from the case for just cause (and I can attest to the just cause, having been a Windows programmer at the time and was following the case). The case sort of went poof then, especially since that was after Clinton was replaced by G. W. Bush

I have absolutely no idea what any of that means but I assume it's bad.

It's not *absolutely awful* and it's much shorter, so it's probably worth your time if you're really enamoured with the world after Season One. And hell, if these three movies end up being good, you'll have to watch it anyway to be caught up. 

But it is much worse in my opinion, and even knowing it was considered a downgrade, I was very disappointed. posted to submission: 3 Animated Psycho-Pass Films Hit The Big Screen in 2019

[16:13:56] Comment: dywqjw5 by TheRedLuden : They are used as concentrated dmg to get rid off specific parts like legs or dangerous weapons. It's far easier to kill a torso with 2 AC5 than with 4 ML because you just need to roll only twice. So an AC build will have less dmg but it will be better as "sniper" or better as "rifleman". Lasers are high dmg and weight efficient but will spread a lot hitting a lot of armor. Missiles compensate the spreding with super high dmg or long range and with high stb dmg.
To be short:
lasers are really good with calling shots and tacticians 
cannons are more efficient at hitting hard and preparing the target for a called shot
missiles are just god. They can do what they want. With a good pilot missiles will do pinpoint high dmg or just spread a lot and pretty much delete all the armor (+ op stb dmg).
You do you but i suggest to try AC5s and AC10s they can be so fun and they cover many niche roles that most of the time other weapons can do but with not optimal results.  posted to submission: Ballistic weapons (AC)

[16:14:07] Comment: dywqjwc by Stecyk : That is really unfortunate.  I'd heard of a similar case with the Titanic, where IRL there was this guy who gave up his life making sure that other people got onto lifeboats, but they used his actual name for one of the villains in the James Cameron movie who was like pushing people off life boats so that he could get on.  Unfortunately I can't remember his name, I heard him mentioned once on a podcast.  

I think this example might be worse though.  There's something about using the almost name and likeness of a holocaust survivor for your evilest Nazi that just doesn't seem right.

Round 2: Oddly enough, I'd say Michael DeSanta. Criminal he may be, but he's still willing to hang out with his kids and outright humiliate a sleezy TV show host for his daughter. That's better than most of the guys on this list.

Because Iranians don't trust American for reasons like this and the false claims of WMD in Iraq. So they both agreed to let the international experts who work for the IAEA to carry out the inspection work because both sides trust that highly respected agency to be truthful.

>All they had access to for inspections were 18 nuclear plants.

You mean the 18 plants that were capable of providing nuclear weapon material? Where else would you want inspected? The power plant that is not capable of producing the enriched uranium in question? 

>Israel‚Äôs Intel, which has been shared with our intel agencies, suggest what they were doing wasn‚Äôt near enough

Nothing released by the Israelis was unknown or even from this decade. It was widely known that in 2003 Iran closed its secret nuke program, hell it was publicly reported on in 2007. Nothing in those documents were surprising to anyone paying attention in the last two decades.

that fantasy world again. this does not exist on either side. unless you want it too. on both sides.

hey. what do you know? that's how I backup too. I pity you having to push a button. We have evolved past the point of having to push a button to backup. it just "happens" on its own in modern PC's

mac's don't do this?

and WE CAN throw something from PC to PC or phone if we want. single click and poof its done. WOW modern software is amazing.

MAC OS and Windows. yep. you guys are the only ones who "NEED" to do this since everything already runs on windows.

"My point is Apple doesn‚Äôt make perfect devices (see keyboard on the 2016/2017 MacBooks) but at least they are simple and so simplified I can trust myself to fix the damn thing in under an hour aside from waiting without much research/digging through several layers of bullshit while at the same time feeling confident to give the machine to my technologically inept mother who can barely install chrome.

why exactly is this complex? its literally fully automated?

and this is exactly the point of apple. dumb appliances. you can buy dumb windows appliances too.

except "WE" can actually fix our machines. you can't. all locked down proprietary and sealed up in epoxy warranty void if you so much as sneeze at the insides. go buy a new machine.

I don't play games. the last game I played was Command and Conquer Red Alert from what? 20 years ago?

apple can afford too offer such support considering what they CHARGE for their hardware.

the same warranty coverage as anything else under those consumer.

you are seriously out of touch with reality dude.

ALL PC's mac or windows are literal turn key appliances for all intents and purposes today.

push the button they turn on and just work. no fuss no hassle. thats not a mac thing. thats a modern PC thing. mac or windows. posted to submission: When the customer asks to speak to the manager but you are the manager

Pavel Loransys (aka Seven Years a Goat): Half-elf bard, College of the Maestro. Spent seven years polymorphed as a goat, currently on a mission to sleep with a member of every race in Faerun.
Nil Silverthread (aka Frank Grimes Sr.): Elf wizard, School of Invention. Invented his own language, lost all his wizard secrets when he got caught cheating, has to start over at level 1 and is very annoyed.
Rabi (aka The MVDPS): Halfling monk, Way of the Shadow. A street urchin who got picked up by a group of ruffians, is just the cutest gosh darn thing but is also our heaviest hitter.
Prudence (aka Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt): Tiefling cleric, Grave Domain. Approaches death with an attitude she calls ‚Äúcheerful‚Äù and ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù but others call ‚Äúweird‚Äù and ‚Äúunsettling‚Äù.

Prudence is my character, the others I designed with input and references from the other players. posted to submission: [OC] So a tiefling, a halfling, a half-elf, and an elf walk into a tavern....
[16:17:05] Comment: dywqp81 by eureka001 : It seems like it has only been a recent thing where a lot of streamers and people on here have gone all in on saying everything needs to be way more difficult and unforgiving, and i can't see it as much more than an e-peen thing and people just repeating what those streamers and "1% of the 1%" types say because it's new new trend.

So now we have this artificially extended grind for light levels where it's all about a few weekly milestones and the heroic strike thing where its rewards are lower than the recommended level to play them. Then there's escalation protocol where the people who went to bungie asked for it to be more difficult so as far as i've heard the level capped out at 385 originally but they bumped the last few waves up to 400 [i don't remember the exact numbers] and in response i've seen a bunch of posts and comments about how "it feels great to get absolutely crushed and knowing i'll have to come back later" and "i'm glad they've made the climb to higher light much longer so i have more of a reason to play.

I don't get it, it seems like a way to just ensure those people won't actually be satisfied and the people who didn't want any of that are on the losing end too, 2 days after the dlc came out i was watching a stream of a bunch of people who powerleveled for the raid do the whole match 3 fireteams into the same instance and more or less effortlessly stomp all 7 waves thing and i hear "well this is gonna get boring fast if we keep getting higher light, we're still underleveled but i feel like the best challenge was when we were even lower". Artificially increasing difficulty and timegating progression is just pointless i mean did anyone actually think it was good that being .5 of a level below 34 in crotas end making you take 50% extra damage was good?

I might've missed the point of this post entirely, but yea the most fun i've had with destiny is playing wrath of the machine since if someone dies or doesn't really know what they're doing you can actually make a new plan on the spot, change how you do it and still succeed and i only really did kings fall a handful of times before being tired of it because it was more like 6 people doing this same thing each time and if one of them messes up then you're all starting over. posted to submission: About the difficulty - from a D1 3000+ hours veteran

[16:18:34] Comment: dywquws by Lord_Mhoram : I'd say it depends on what you like. If you're into new movies and want to see reviews of what's in the theater, start with *Half in the Bag*, beginning with the most recent ones. For more detailed analysis of other, usually older works, the more serious version would be *Re:View*, and the funnier (though still solid on analysis) version is the Plinkett reviews. *Best of the Worst* breaks down roughly into two groups: discussion of bad/B-movies, and discussion of "randomly" selected video tapes which could be anything from self-help instructional videos to concert videos. In both types of BotW, the quality of the films varies wildly, and often the humor is in breaking down how bad they are. posted to submission: New fan of RLM, what are some of the differences in the shows they have?

[16:19:15] Comment: dywquxi by beengrim32 : 

What I got from your original argument was that the death penalty is an out dated relic of the past that is no longer necessary. It does seem like you are more concerned with the state‚Äôs right to kill which is a valid argument. 

My perspective is that we live in a less than perfect society in which acts of violence still occur and that reserving the states right to kill in limited cases of extreme violence is not entirely immoral.   Thinking of it this way allows for us to focus on the possibility of particular extreme examples that stand out from all other cases. I‚Äôm advocating that we do ethics in real-time and deliberate on the specifics of the particular cases instead of stopping at top level generalities.

How is this different from Thrall? As for all the other stuff. This isn't about justifying actions of war(Otherwise we'd go down a long rabbit hole about resources and why each side does what it does), its highlighting the original comment that Jaina was the only one making compromises. She wasn't completely innocent here either. It wasn't a one-sided relationship as stated. All the attacks are merely pointing out she waged war against the Horde too- which are clear situations where she wasn't compromising, and not that different from Thrall.  posted to submission: This artist has a gift.

[16:22:32] Comment: dywqyq1 by WayeeCool : EA, much like Ubisoft, tends to always put the effort in to optimize for AMD cards.  If BF1 and Battlefront were any indication, the next battlefield should run great on a Vega56 or any new equivalent offering AMD has out at the time.

A lot of games from smaller publishers don't take advantage of all the API/hardware features that AMDs newest hardware offers.  It's a real shame, because when features such as rapid packed math and full DX12 support are implemented, Vega trades blows with the 1080 ti. posted to submission: AMD GPU Offerings For Next Battlefield
[16:22:33] Comment: dywqyq3 by always_wear_pyjamas : I've worked as a mountain guide on different, much more cracked glacial outlets (sv√≠nafells- and s√≥lheima-). Ones that I would not go on at all without real crampons and full gear. For these that are really flat and easier to get around on I would be happy with some caution, careful route finding and pretty simple and light crampons (not the 1kg full on mountaineering ones). It would still take some care and thought to pick the right ones. I've seen some of these flatter highland glacier outlets (like Tungna√°rj√∂kull is), Dyngjuj√∂kull especially, while thinking about how it would be to cross it on foot without crampons, and I would totally do it (but I'd also advise most other people not to do it). In summer the glacier isn't that slippery, and great parts of it have lots of ash so they are really not that bad. Also the crevasses that are there are mostly due to melt, not glacial movement and ice sheet dynamics, so they are more U-shaped rather than V-shaped, so they are a lot more shallow and easier to navigate around and in and less dangerous. They will also not be covered by snow, so they are a lot more predictable than high glacier crevasses.

You can see them quite nicely on the aerial pictures on www.map.is, to the point of seeing the texture of the surface nicely. While it may not be the most recent pictures and not reliable in that sense, it can give you an idea of what the glacier is like. You can also compare the aerial pictures to the pictures in the album you linked to, where they cross Skei√∞ar√°rj√∂kull.

Try tracing some of the big rivers to the point where they come from under the glacier, to see where you would want to get on and off and what the route looks like. Thankfully water is denser than ice, so it disappears under the surface. While you might see some small rivers on the glacier surface they should not be very large and if too large to jump across should be easy to navigate around. But like I said I would also be worried about mud and sinkholes in the soaked glacial silt/mud/ash.

You might be able to see some better pictures of these glaciers by googling their names, or looking for geotagged pictures on google earth. It might bring up some jeep blogs.

Of course a thing to focus on is careful stepping and absolute avoidance of immobilizing accidents. While you can easily walk in this terrain if you are a fit and experienced hiker, it would be an absolute clusterfuck to move someone out if they were unable to walk themselves. posted to submission: Hiking Askja-Nyidalur-Landmannalaugar.

[16:23:52] Comment: dywr4bf by Trumplethinskin : > still no explanation as to how removing the iran deal improves world security


I can field this one. 

Iran was secretly developing nukes all along, so they have nukes already.  They got away with this by bribing American and EU officials to falsify inspection reports. Also, the deal didn't allow inspections and Iran was just self-reporting. Also, Obama had to pay off Iran to stay silent, and those payments were continuing even after Trump took office. 

Now that Trump has ended the deal the Obama payments are no longer being made and Iran is pissed. They're going to retaliate by naming names, i.e., the officials they bribed, and when everyone finds out about this corruption it will destroy the deep state.

[16:26:16] Comment: dywrabn by smaxup : Has it not been a common rumour that Maul survived past TPM for over a decade now? Similarly to how Boba was rumoured to have escaped the Sarlaac. These days almost everyone has access to Google so people will be able to find a quick answer to how he survived, and it might spark an interest in the CW or Rebels cartoons.

I understand being annoyed at the lack of Boba in this movie though. It's a missed opportunity for a cameo or even some scenes to flesh out his character. It would be like having a Kenobi movie and expecting Maul or Vader to appear, and then getting an unnecessary cameo from Tarkin or Greedo.

Out of interest, would you be happy for Maul to be in Solo if Boba was too and had an equal or greater amount of screentime? posted to submission: Info on Why This Season is Split

Yes the LN third parties to transact, but you could say the same thing as the miners in a BCH transaction.  The key is that **trusted** third parties are eliminated.  It is accurate to say there are no trusted 3rd parties in the LN either, because of the cryptographic Hashed Timelocked Contract.  

What could be argued is that the LN is far less censorship resistant, because any of the competing miners can pick up your TX if another censors it (decentralized) whereas a node you have a payment channel with can censor all movement of funds you have locked in that channel (centralized) posted to submission: The Idea of P2P Electronic Cash: Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin Core

That's the thing. If I point out how Joseph Smith's revelations seem awfully convenient, I can just say "well, I've seen some good explanations" and point to some Mormon apologist. If you're willing to add more assumptions to a position, you can defend anything pretty much infinitely. The occam's razor position would be he might have just been a guy making things up. We know guys exist. We know they make claims. We know people start religions for self-serving reasons. These are all proven. Gods, miracles, Prophets, etc are all unproven.

[16:27:36] Comment: dywracv by kitolz : No one has posted the actual reason for the limit. They stated in interviews early on (don't remember where) that they tested unlimited deck slots and for a large chunk of players they found a tendency to just keep creating decka without deleting old ones. Once it became mess they just quit instead of going through the trouble of cleaning up.

The 9 deck limit was bearable in vanilla, and then bumped up to 18. I wouldn't say no to another increase of course. There's a lot of expansions now, and I want more slots for wild decks.  posted to submission: I know we just recently got more deck-slots, but why is there even a limit in the first place?

[16:28:39] Comment: dywrf13 by anvith_dosapati : Sometimes the given sequence may not be AP,GP or HP.

In such cases consider the difference of successive terms, this is known as first order diffs.

Tn --> nth term

If first order differences are in AP(common difference) then Tn = an¬≤+bn+c
Where a,b,c are contants.

We can find the values of a,b,c by putting n = 1,2,3..

i.e, by n=1 , a+b+c = 1
by n= 2, 4a+2b+c = 2
by n= 3,9a+3b+c = 5

No average functioning individual is going to go into their 30s without ever having had a steady gf/bf. If they do, it's very likely because they have some major issues.

Commitment issues, mommy issues, mental issues, or spent their early adulthood in jail all come to mind. posted to submission: How much of a red flag is no dating/relationship experience for a person in their early/mid 30s?

Well, if you're going to seek this kind of help here, I'll pretend to be the kind that can give it. I mean, I may be wrong, but I doubt it

Ending your relationship with your computer seems to be your goal, but the key issue is your anxiety. Would it be fair to say that you're comfortable when you're in control, like in a video game, but when the rules are less linear and consequences less clearly related to your actions, such as IRL, you begin to panic?

Even if you quit gaming cold turkey, you will not have solved the issue. As far as humans go, all the way back to neanderthals, retaining that microcosm of control of your environment has been a defining factor of survival. The difference is, with you, instead of being taught, trained and programmed to control the literal world around you like everyone in your family before you, you've been acclimatised to a different set of rules, ones that don't apply when the computer is off. 

Withstanding the brutality of life while you get to better know the score is a constant battle, but it gets easier. I wouldn't have been able to do it myself without video games. Keep that in mind. posted to submission: Help with gaming addiction (Serious)

[16:28:58] Comment: dywrf1h by lousquetaire : Happened to my dad twenty years ago. Now he laughs about it but he told me it was his scariest camping experience.

He was hiking in rural France with a friend and night was falling. They had stop in a little town to shop groceries and went back in the woods to try and find a place to sleep. Mind you, they didn't have any lamp as they were young and careless, and soon they didn't see much more. The moon was bright enough for them to be aware that they were still on a forest path, but nowhere to plant a tent. Soon, they don't see anything anymore, but realize their environment has changed and they seem to be in a larger space than the path. There is grass on the ground. They assume they are in a clearing and set up tent. In the morning, they are woken up by very loud engine noises, very close to them, and they jump out of the tent, scared as shit. Turned out they slept on a roundabout in the middle of road works and the construction guys had kindly turned on the engines to warn them they should leave... posted to submission: [Serious] Campers of reddit, what is the scariest/creepiest/most disturbing thing that has happened to you in the woods?

[16:29:17] Comment: dywrf1u by OneMoreGamer : Just replace taxation of money with sexual taxation.  Imagine for a second a form of sexual socialism, where everyone is able to obtain some sexual intimacy.  Now, people who completely abstain from sexuality activity aren't taxed at all, but people who don't are taxed.  Let's say the tax rate is low, say 10%.  So for every 9 times they have sex with someone they want, they have to spend 1 time having sex with someone they don't.

Now, while this sounds extreme and silly, a number of distopian novels have included this as part of a omnipotent government.

Would statist claim this is consensual or that it is rape?  Would they be appalled by the very notion of having to detail all of their sexual activity so that the government can know they are paying their 10% tax?  Would the argument that "if you don't want to pay the sexual tax, you could just avoid sex" work at all?

From every instance I see, they outright claim it is rape and non-voluntary.  Many go so far as to claim sexual socialism that merely works by taxing money and using it to buy sexual services is rape (a few countries have this implemented for the physically disabled, so you can't even call this fiction).

Now, they'll quickly take to saying that sex is different than other activity, but that is a fallacy to try to hold onto their emotional view points.  To be exact, it is special pleading, because every other way in which you sell your body (many jobs do physical damage to the body that builds up over a lifetime), they are fine with a tax. posted to submission: Taxation is voluntary

[16:29:37] Comment: dywrf2c by pobelterR : Since at most studios Creature TD is a mix between Rigging and Creature FX, it depends on what are you most focused on, what stage is the movie at, your skill level etc. I focus on creating simulation rigs (muscle, cloth, hair) more, and after I do shot finalling / shot sculpt, cloth and hair simulations. Usually a day for me is I go in around 10 am, I check my renders from the previous days, check if they need any correction, I put my tasks on waiting for approval when the render looks good. Go have a coffee etc, talk with my supervisor about my tasks, check mails / notifications (this so far takes like 1-1,5 hour), and after that put on my headphones till the end of the day usually (unless someone needs help or someone comes to talk to me + lunch time obvs). I usually have 2-3-4 maya open, running simulations constantly. I look at references in the meanwhile sometimes, I also note problems with the tools and scripts and fix them if I can, or if I can't I nag our pipeline guys with that. A lot of times it happens that some unexpected error come up, so usually have to fix them quickly in the asset, or have to create a subrig for something, this is usually everydays stuff. Then again, this is when the animators finished most of the animations, and we have crunch time with shot simulations. Usually before we have any animation, we create the assets, then it's different. We usually sit down or something and start talking about ideas to have solutions, for example there is a fat character but we dont have time to do muscle setup, so how can we create the rig so the body won't have any interpenetrations etc.  posted to submission: Feature film creature TDs, what's an average day at the studio like for you?

[16:29:51] Comment: dywrf2x by Trajer : Round 1 - Thanos overpowers Ronan and takes the stone. Using the stone, he is able to defeat Hela in one-on-one combat, and possibly some Soul Gem shenanigans with her undead army. Armed with the Space, Soul and Power gem, he confronts Malekith, who has probably fully unlocked the powers of the Reality gem. Malekith is smart enough to know who he's messing with, and smart enough to know what the infinity stones are. He turns Thanos into a rubber duck and takes the 3 stones from him. On the off-chance Malekith hasn't unlocked the full power, Thanos can overpower him and take it. He can take the time stone easily from Kaecillius (the same was as from Strange, but probably using Kaecillius' family to threaten him instead of Stark). With the power of all 5 other gems, he can completely put an end to Ultron and recover the Mind stone. Thanos 3/10.

Round 2 - He probably still goes for the power gem first, and takes it. He may see Ultron as the biggest threat and try to take him out first by a full-scale invasion similar to the movie. Ultron handily wipes out his black order and stops the entire invasion. Ultron, at this point, has entirely assimilated Earth as we've seen him do in the comics. If Thanos goes after Ultron with just the Soul and Power gem, Thanos loses 1/10. If he decides to go for Malekith next, he probably loses 2/10. His best chances would be putting Malekith 2nd to last and Ultron last, which I'd give him maybe a 6/10 chance.

Round 3 - Ultron has the best chance. He could get into the Sanctum and steal the Time gem by brute force, probably use the Mind stone to mind control sorcerers or Kaecillius himself. If he can fully assimilate all of Earth, which I assume he can and will, it's just a matter of finding the other stones.   posted to submission: How would Infinity War go if the Avengers had failed in every previous movie with an infinity stone?

[16:30:57] Comment: dywri72 by kickstand : It is futile and arguably unethical to date someone to try to change them.

That said, she's a person, and she might learn something from you, and maybe vice versa. I don't see any reason why you shouldn't date her once, or a few times, and get to know her, and see her perspective on things. As long as your intent is not to change her. posted to submission: Met a nice girl on okcupid, but she seems to be a fundamentalist Christian. Is there a chance I can convert her?

[16:31:39] Comment: dywri7r by 1D13 : I wouldn't give the character any special powers other than unique insight. The insight would be game mechanics, the wizard may be able to discern what a "level" is, or how many "hit points" people have. Perhaps the character even has copies of everyone's character sheet, and the ability to discern the stats of NPCs.

Ultimately, this would just be a gimmick since most meta knowledge an in game character could have the players already have. In this campaign the gimmick would be that meta gaming is part of the story.  posted to submission: Campaign based on meta gaming

[16:35:14] Comment: dywrp35 by SubmissiveMess : Well, for me, I was a sub long before I got into this, but I was playing overwatch with someone I had just met, We had naturally just kind of taken our natural roles \(I was submissive to them fairly shortly after I got to know them\) and after some pocketing I jokingly referred to them as my pimp.

They then offered me out to the rest of the team in public chat, saying what i'd do for them sexually. I felt such a rush of emotions, good and bad \(mostly very, very good\) as I read through what she was saying. I like property and I enjoyed every second of it.

Then, about a week ago, I found this sub and felt at home. 

As for tips, start with something... Inconsequential? Maybe get your dom to punish you in some way if you don't revive them or heal enough after the round is over. Start small!

[16:37:57] Comment: dywru0x by tvannatta2012 : Those monitors are not up to par. 
You need a 4k monitor cut and dry. If you're doing 4K stuff you'll have no idea how your colors are rendering on a 1080P monitor.

 As others have pointed out you need ram of the same same frequency and you should get 4 sticks. Not sure about this Mobo but allot of systems have trouble with 3 sticks. Personally I'd recommend dumping the extra stick and get that 4K monitor it really is a big deal to know how your colors are rendering. You'll lose some performance from this but ram is easy to upgrade later when you have the cash to add little more to your machine. 

Liquid cooling is cool and all, but it's cost ineffective. 
You should find a larger case and go complete air-cooling and when I say bigger case. I do mean a full size tower. Video editing and rendering in 4K is some searious workloads and your machine WILL get hot, so a ton of fans+big case for them all.  You're on a tight budget so you need cost efficiency and you can get a fan based cpu cooler for half the price of that one, that should open a little wiggle room for you to buy another set of ram or proper monitor. 

Your Cpu is a good one and I personally prefer Intel but you may consider going for AMDS Ryzen it's way more cost effective. I don't know much at all about ryzens as I'm a fan boy, but I hear good things lately the Ryzen 5 is real nice mmmk. 

You may also want to look into a workstation Gpu, I know literally nothing about them but they are better if you're not going to play games on it. 

If you got questions ask em and I'll try to help sort it out. I have no formal education on the topics but I've done a bit of research.

One has to remember that Romania was a proper, African level third world country in the 1990s, thanks to Ceausescu's failed policies and historical backwardness. Nowadays, we've surpassed all of our neighbours, except for Hungary. I'm quite proud of my country, no matter what smug, arrogant westerners say. I'm not ungrateful, a lot of our growth is due to the EU, but the Romania bashing on here sometimes is ridiculous.  posted to submission: Poland Moves Closer to Developed Market Status

[16:39:47] Comment: dywrz3v by Batbuckleyourpants : It blows my mind that anyone can even think that...

The deal did not even stop them from enriching Uranium, They have been freely building up their low grade stockpile so that it is all ready to be enriched at a moment's notice. They have 14.000 centrifuges ready to activate at the push of a button.

The deal was so terrible [Iran supposedly claim they bribed politicians to vote yes on it.](https://twitter.com/Raman_Ghavami/status/993932711315329025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bizpacreview.com%2F2018%2F05%2F13%2Fangry-iran-threatens-to-expose-western-officials-who-took-bribes-to-make-nuke-deal-happen-633970&tfw_creator=bizpacreview&tfw_site=bizpacreview), which frankly is the only reason i can imagine why they accepted it. That, and John Kerry literally having a Well connected Iranian as son in law. The Iranian foreign minister was even best man at his daughters wedding.

The corrupt deal gave them 10 years free of sanctions to freely build up their military, which is what they are doing, with their army already 40% stronger in just 3 years... it was an absolute disaster, and in 8 years we would will been right back where we started, but with Iran's military LITERALLY several times stronger.

You have to be blind to believe the deal solved anything. History will remember it as the most bewilderingly idiotic deal since Neville chamberlain handed Czechoslovakia to Hitler, thinking it would be a first step towards peace, even as the Nazis massively and overtly prepared for another war. posted to submission: Trump and Netanyahu Aligned Against Iran as Tensions Soar

You pyoentially could still size down even from that and it would fit okay.  I think the length would be borderline if you did that, depening on how tall you are, but he medium is already a little over 28" in length.  

I say this because I have room to wear a t-shirt and a lighter crewnecker underneath with no problems in restriction.  My weight is slightly below what I normally weigh (5-10 lbs), but I know it isn't that close to make a huge difference on the fit. posted to submission: KITH X COLUMBIA SANTA ANNA WINDBREAKER EXPLORATION SIZING

2. Yes, if you have a path from a to b, the reverse of that path goes from b to a.
3. Sort of. If you can get from a to b and you can get from b to c, then it follows that you can get from a to c (first by walking down the a-b path to b, then down the b-c path to c). More formally, if you append the b-c path to the a-b path, you get an a-c walk. The hint allows you to turn that into an a-c path.   posted to submission: Discrete Math 1: Graphing, show that the property of being connected is an equivalence relation. Please help, how!?

[16:41:19] Comment: dyws2h6 by SsurebreC : Let's parse this example a bit:

* an active shooter objectively exists
* there is objective proof that they are a danger to others
* they have already killed 15 others

Yes, causing harm in your example makes sense.

I was talking to another Christian a LONG time ago (damn you /u/coffee_beagle, for leaving me). The conversation went to harm vs. saving someone. He said that to him, he'd push me out of the way if there was a truck coming towards me at high speed. I told him that I'd likely thank him because there's objective harm about that truck which would otherwise kill me. However, religion has no such objectivity. Would it still be OK for him to push me into the ground because of a truck he believes was coming? He said yes.

You see this in the news sometimes, when a parent kills their "evil" children because they believed they were the anti-Christ or to stop them from sinning.

This is the same thing. So where do you draw the line because it seems like the slippery slope argument leads to Christians killing abortion doctors for the greater good based on their beliefs. posted to submission: My father just said this to me, how do believers really believe this stuff?

That's what confuses me about these Pennywise threads - unless you specify miniseries or movie Pennywise, you're not really putting the character you think you are, against people. 

For this, none of the other characters matter at all because they don't have the special empowerment the Loser's Club has.

[16:42:28] Comment: dyws2i1 by DeathlordExu : i'm in the beta, yes. 

Warfronts are boring. Island expeditions imo (as someone who likes to run resource bgs, which is what they are) are also not really fun content, especially in PVE. 

BfA seems to me at least like they are smashing 2 expansions that have nothing to do with each other together. 

* The Old God themed expansion is AWESOME, with a very good story, fun dungeons and raids, very nice leveling experience
* The Faction War themed expansion is *very* boring. Like *exceedingly* boring. It's not like MoP, where the faction war story was actually fleshed out, and even if you hated Garrosh's guts you understood what was going on and why. 

In BfA everything about the faction war is contrived, to start with the whole "I've never seen anything like it" stupidity when it comes to the Azerite war machines, like, fuck you Genn, the Alliance has a fucking LASER-EQUIPPED SPACESHIP full of Warframes, dafuq are you talking about? 

Seriously. When I started playing the beta I wasn't very enthused, but now I'm just angry, because the Old God stuff is really **well done**, and whoever came up with it doesn't deserve to be paired with the total nitwit who wrote the faction war stuff.  posted to submission: BFA Content

But my weight worries me a bit these days
However, chocolate. Can I have a bit of chocolate?
But wait a while! Wait a while! Wait! Wait! Wait!*-

Ha ha. I know why you said this, because I've not seen a more hated Metal band in a loong time, like Babymetal (even more than Ghost by elitist morons). I think the band is nice, although is not for me, I need lyrics more related to the subjects I love; that said. They're one of the most important phenomenons in Metal of today, and the amount of fans exceedes the haters by a mile. Even if it's not my kind of Metal band, I think it's a pretty solid act, and I've seen classic Metal Legends like Abbath Doom Occulta, Rob Halford and Jeff Walker (vocalist/ bassist of Carcass), having photoshots with them, so...haters of Babymetal are pathetic. If you don't like it, leave it and go listen to your bands.

Anyone whining about Ghost having "poppy" songs in this Era, should never have listened to *Satan Prayer*, *Jigolo Har Megido* or *Cirice* . Yes, *Cirice* riff is thunderous, but if you tell me the chorus is not poppy, c'mon...

So I don't see the drama. Wait until you have the whole album and listen to it, then judge it. For what I've heard, I've a winner for being my favorite, *Faith*. Also, it's funny, really funny how there was people worried about hearing *Dance Macabre* would have disco-vibe; and now, you see everyone is dying to hear the studio version! Ha ha, it's eay to see, TF is a genius. Personally, if I'm dying for listening to one of the new tracks, is *Faith*.

And about the lyrics...youcan please find a single flaw in *Faith*'s lyrics for not being like Ghost in previous releases? I find it not only Heavy as fuck, but also, its lyrics are another "*Idolatrine" II" punch. I was dying to see another song which a large "fuck you, Idol Latrine" in the lyrics. And I'm glad there's other new one awaiting in *Prequelle*.

[16:44:35] Comment: dyws7fq by jowit2 : No you dont have to be sl300+. You Just need the correct gear and stats. Hell you can even oneshot the pontiff at sl1. If you have someone to cast sacred oath its fairly easily done.

If you just want good damage. Use sellsword twinblades, old wolf curved sword in offhand.

Rings pontiff right eye, Lloyds sword and you're good to go.

For highest damage. Morion blade rtsr setup, (weapon of your choice(like lothric knight ugs, to demolish bosses in seconds use sellsword twinblades)

Rtsr

Morion blade(+25%?), red tearstone(+25%?) flynns (preferably no armour), dragon torso stone+ dragon roar,pontiffs right eye, ring of choice(hornets ring for e.g. dependant on boss), good weapon with best possible infusion (sellsword twinblades, lothric knight greatsword both sharp infused), Secret sacred oath (Cast rapport on the priests in lothric castle for a second sacred oath that stacks with the Players sacred oath)

Sacred oath, deep protection(or carthus beacon for sellsword twinblades idk whats better in that case, but i personally prefer deep protection back in the day all of this used to stack together), Power within? Idk if it stacks with deep protection.

[16:44:57] Comment: dyws7fy by TheRealMeatloaf : Yes, electricity costs the same to produce. So that's the supply side. You're not accounting for the *demand* side.

Through the day (peak time) the demand is at its highest. Our plants have to run at full capacity (or close to it) and the grid has to be more closely monitored to avoid brownouts.

During off peak hours the electricity usage is so low we have to either vent off the steam at our nuke plants to drop production (a time, labour and cost intensive process) or give away our power for pennies on the dollar because we have such a large surplus.

So instead of giving power away to foreign states at $0.02/kWh why not offer Ontario rate payers a 40% discount to use more at those times? posted to submission: An NDP government would make hydro public again, end off-peak pricing, Horwath says in Sudbury | The Star

[16:49:03] Comment: dywshp0 by OverallRaisin : That... felt off. Part of it has honesty but part of it still seems dishonest and fake. Maybe it's all those thumbs up Paul is giving. 

I do think they are right to stop vlogging but they keep insisting it's because of JJ's bad health and how hard it is to film and edit. But that's a very vague statement. Her health has gone downhill but it's her mental health and possibly an eating disorder and possibly there is some actual health problem too, like IBS. 

I'm glad they are stopping the videos and hopefully they stay away long enough to get back to living and enjoying life and will not want to come back to it. This is probably a relief to JJ because she can stop the act now. She doesn't need to use a wheelchair every day, have her service dog by her side, starve herself, and lay around all the time. I hope she gets some therapy and then maybe gets a job. 

For some reason I have a feeling they will be back. They can be so arrogant and self obsessed. I hope I am wrong and that they won't be back. They should also break ties with AJ and Dudd but I don't see that happening.  posted to submission: JJ & Paul the DB post their real douchey and cocky final ‚ÄúAdieu and Goodnight‚Äù *sniff, sniff*

But he is also part of a right wing echo chamber, sharpio etc that support ethnic cleansing in Palestine. 

And now he has come out in favour of that ethnic cleansing.


He cant be so ignorant of whats happening there to accidentally confuse opposition to ethnic cleansing with anti semitism.


But I agree that the constant pressure he is getting because the pomo neo marxist narrative comes from the far right and is linked to nazism it would cause him to over compensate. 


I remember some article said his understanding of pm and marxism was shallow and he cathy numaned it on twitter, saying that it accused him of being shallow.

It is light, and airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds.  But if you let go of down, it falls down. So that's which way down is, it's the direction that gravity is pulling everything. Now for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up, but where are falling things going?

[16:51:43] Comment: dywsksj by Uconnvict123 : Flowers draft position is irrelevant at this point. What matters is creating a winning offensive line, and we are more positioned to do that with flowers at RT than any other option. 

If flowers becomes a locker room cancer, then you might have to get rid of him. But he can skip ota and be angry to himself, as long as it doesn't affect the rest of the team, it's whatever. I want to win. I'm tired of seeing Eli get killed. Getting rid of flowers is more likely to end up like last season. I don't like flowers, I don't like his attitude, but if he avoids being a cancer and plays better than anyone else, I'll take it. 

Football is a business, and that business is winning. I wouldn't let personal problems affect the chances of this team at winning a super bowl.  posted to submission: Did we sign any UDFA OT‚Äôs?
[16:51:44] Comment: dywsksk by Cherish_Dipp : \*JESUS\*. Oh hun, \-hugs hard if wanted\- \-heaps of blankets and preferred drink\- This is utter BULLSHIT. You don't have to constantly put up with this shitty behavior. It's \*disgusting\*. I think the reason why you didn't sucker punch her was because you just gave birth. Fucking bitch.

I say she's trying to live \*through you\* specifically. Wants to be there when hubby proposed? Saying 'her' children when they're yours?

She doesn't respect you nor take you seriously. Sit hubby down and discuss that you both need to unite and bring down hell fire and punishment the moment she disrespects you, ignores boundaries and is just being a shitty person. Right down to what she says, such as 'my kids'. She laughs it off because she can claim it's a joke even though we all know it isn't and then does it again anyway because it's you and your hubby's word \(that neither she takes seriously\) that's stopping her from doing it again. Remind her they \*are not\* and threaten no more visits for a period of time. And \*go through with it\*. She will through the biggest fit, but if she shows up unannounced, that deadline for no\-visits just got extended. Or a meet up, it just got cancelled. 

She needs to know that if she wants to be involved, there are boundaries, there are rules and she needs to earn trust and relationships.  Usually, a quick word with of a 'no', 'that's not okay', 'I'm sorry, but you're making me uncomfortable/you're crossing boundaries' is enough to make sane people stop. You said it yourself, she's \*not\* okay, and further action might need to be taken for a more peaceful life. 

I'm so sorry you to deal with this. Have you told her her behavior at the hospital wasn't okay? IF she doesn't acknowledge it wasn't, then you could put the brakes on her visiting the baby. You are the parent. If I may spew more, I also agree with the other commentors \- info diet! On everything, including images.

Good luck hun \- use that rage!! You are \*not\* crazy, you are not in the wrong. That bitch needs to know she fucked with the wrong mum!! posted to submission: MIL tried to shove MY nipple into my -1 day old son, pushing aside the lactation consultant, when she‚Äôd never herself nursed, and was not supposed to be in the room... and other fun tales.

[16:52:45] Comment: dywskt8 by aboba_ : I'm comparing it to downtown Victoria, people here refuse to use Langford as a comparison even though the prices are more reasonable. Langford would be comparable to further from town in Tokyo.

Also, you're right that that amount in Japan has a different purchasing power than here, but you fail to account for the fact that the average household income in Japan is far lower too.  posted to submission: $90 million going to build 2,010 rental units in Greater Victoria

[16:53:51] Comment: dywsqq5 by kmck96 : Obviously just about everything in running, and the "180 spm" figure is no exception. Higher cadence is good for a lot of reasons (hard to overstride with a high cadence, usually better biomechanics, less bouncing, not as hard on your legs/joints) but if you have long legs it's tough to keep it up there regularly. My cadence is a little low too; on easy days, I try to keep it in the 168-170 range. During long races (5k+) it's usually 175-178. It hardly ever gets to that 180 spm mark, though. It might be something to work on through drills or running with 180 bpm music once or twice a week but I wouldn't stress about it too much. posted to submission: Sunday General Discussion

[16:54:23] Comment: dywsqqk by ellipticalplum : Call me naive but I think she might be serious. I think it also makes sense with the rift we've seen between her and AJ- she didn't visit her in the hospital this last time. I really think her family sat her down and had a very serious talk about her health and maybe even called her out on her probable ED. Also I was shocked at how she looked today: natural hair (not straightened), comfortable t-shirt not showing port, no sick face or mannequin speech. 

If she is serious about this, and I sincerely hope she is getting REAL help of the psychological kind and working with doctors to gain weight and get her health back (not fishing for another dx), I wish her the best and I'll be so happy for her if she keeps her word. She's so young and truly has her whole life ahead of her.

[16:55:44] Comment: dywsvpy by The_Original_Gronkie : The incompetence, negligence, and corruption of the George W Bush administration is responsible for the avoidable deaths of over 10,000 Americans, and countless foreign nationals, as well as the worst economic crash since the Great Depression. There isn't one positive outcome of the Bush administration. He left America far worse than he found it.

I chalk it up to him being stupid and manipulated by smart, evil chickenhawks. You want to chalk it up to his intelligence, which makes him one of those evil people. Either way doesn't look good for George.

His brother Jeb! was the smart one, but I'll never forgive him for scheming to get his brother elected. Besides, Jeb turned out to embrace the same war-mongering chickenhawk Neo-con maniacs as his brother and father. It's the Bush way, I guess.

I base my opinion of George Bush based on the evidence of his administration, judging it from a decade later, and it was an abject faliure, and so was he as a leader.

[16:57:03] Comment: dywsvqw by tiffaniamelodia : Thanks for sharing. I think there are times when we think we're invincible. I know I used to think there was no way a guy would ever make me feel like I needed him because  if he doesn't want me , why would I want him? I also never thought I would be left in the dust. But i was bound to have a bad experience in love. We all will and sometimes more than once. I did fall in love and after our breakup, it felt hard to breathe. But I don't regret falling for this guy. My ex was a good guy, he was a good start up boyfriend. Him and I were very different and never really learned how to resolve problems together. 
I am still going through the motions but I am doing much better than how I was the day he left.
I do miss him and want him. But I remind myself, do I really want someone who would give up so easily on me? Someone who would run away like he did? Someone who suffers from depression and cannot get out of his head? Someone who distrusts women because of his past? Someone who can relapse to drug addiction? 
No, I don't want to deal with issues like that. Relationships are hard as it is. Hope he finds peace with himself and hop he finds someone who can be there for him. I can't do that for him. I tried and it just hurt to see him down and not being able to break free from his own misery. 
I am looking forward to my next relationship. But for now, I just want to enjoy life on my own. But if I fall in love again, I hope this guy can be my rock and I will work hard to be his.  posted to submission: Lessons and remaining subbed

[16:57:24] Comment: dywsvra by garnix2 : My experience is different.
When I travel for work I am quite happy to have my switch because I have nothing else to do at the hotel in the evening.
Also in the plane, I am quite bored if I only watch movies and do not play. I am not a movie type of person.
Then for vacation,it depends where and when you go.
If you go for example to Iceland in the winter, your evenings will be long and relaxing...
If you go to a "dangerous" country you will also not stay out late.

But you are going with friends so you should just drink in the evening.

I have a hard time delivering bad news, so I often think throwing encouraging words at it will somehow mask the reality of the situation. The more straight forward you can be about something the better, but it can be a really hard line to walk between being an honest friend and coming off as an insensitive asshole. posted to submission: When did being overly positive instead of being realistic harm you or anyone else?

I'm sorry that you are hurting, I'm sure that you are in terrible pain over this loss, and truly, I hope you recover well and I wish you the best.

Yes, it can be a workstation. It can be a whole user interface for your computer.

VIM is a text editor, emacs is an extensible interface for dealing with text. Elisp is a full programming language and has deep hooks into emacs, so you can change just about anything.

> How do I set up the add-ons and what are the most commonly needed programmers?

I recommend installing use-package and requiring your packages in your .emacs or init.el.

>All I'm saying is  

This phrase is not supposed to be used like that. Nowhere in our conversation have you said something that links in to what follows the phrase so it is unfortunately wrong. While I commend you using words that you learn, maybe it is best to stick more to what you are more certain about.   

Look up the definition of lost cause as well because the usage here is quite iffy.

[17:00:15] Comment: dywt32s by Oct2006 : That's because CoD's loot box system didn't affect progression other than the occasional XP boost that was so common everyone got them constantly. Sure, you can pay for loot boxes, but all you'll get it weapon and character skins and the occasional XP boost. 

BF2's loot boxes directly affected gameplay and progression, and you could pay to essentially "get better" at the game.

Microtransactions are not the problem. I love Fortnite's microtansactions. They're extremely well done, they add challenges to the game, and none of it affects gameplay elements (unless you consider skins that may be harder to see in certain terrains to be gameplay affecting). Microtansactions that allow you to purchase your way to the top of a leaderboard are the problem.  posted to submission: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.

u should precook the rice quite heavily compared to normal risotto rice. 
just an idea. 

u can also cook it with normal regular rice. i recommend 1part wild rice to 4 parts normal rice. also precook the wild rice as it takes longer to cook. it is better when you let the steam sit in the rice cooker/pot for about 10 mins before opening to eat. this helps soften the skins making it easier to eat. posted to submission: Any interesting recipe ideas for wild rice?

It already fucking played out. 20 years ago. There is no new evidence. This was not dredged up by the alleged victim. There is nothing to play out, which is what people like you don't understand. I haven't seen a single person call the accuser a lying bitch and get upvoted. 

The fact is, the accuser requested that the trial be dropped 20 years ago. There is no known evidence that this event happened. Therefore, Patricia  must be *presumed* innocent. Absolutely has to. That doesn't mean the event 100% didn't happen, but  you MUST treat it as such. To believe that Patricia raped this woman is irresponsible and baseless. There's no reason to go in on the alleged victim and call her a liar.

[17:04:17] Comment: dywt8s9 by kieslowskifan : Stieve was basically a Nazi apologist.

The book in question is Friedrich Stieve's 1940 book *Was die Welt nicht wollte: Hitlers Friedensangebote 1933‚Äì1939* (*What the World Rejected: Hitler's Peace offers 1933-1939*). Stieve was an archivist and official active in the German Foreign Ministry. This was a piece of agitprop produced during the war's early stages that tried to paint Germany as the aggrieved party in the European conflict. Stieve put a gloss on German foreign policy and claimed that Hitler constantly sought an accommodation with the West for peace. These included a Reichstag speech (21 May 1935) where he claimed Germany had not violated the Versailles Treaty but would participate in a proper bilateral and multilateral talks from an equitable position or the [Franco-German Treaty of 1938](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/ylbk028.asp) to respect each other's borders. 

None of these offers were made in good faith, as seen in Germany's abrogation of the Munich Pact- Stieve's fifth offer. For example, Hitler's 1935 initiative did bear fruit with the Anglo-German Naval agreement of June 1935. The Germans though never really honored the agreement to a fleet of 35% of the tonnage of the RN, with Hitler directed the Kriegsmarine to plan for a massive building project for an eventual war with the UK. The lower priority in defense spending for the navy prevented the Kriegsmarine from expanding beyond the limits before Germany unilaterally abrogated the Treaty, but its design process envisioned ships that would exceed the 35% limit. 

Even had there been sincerity behind these initiatives at the time they were made, experience showed that Hitler regarded international agreements as an nonbinding inconveniences.  The war showed the hollowness of Hitler's commitment to peace. The basic preconditions of his two main peace offers during the warp- both after the conquest of Poland and later France- were that the Allies accept all of Germany's territorial claims and give sanction to Hitler's violation of international treaties and agreements. Europe's die-hard *Realpolitiker*s at the time recognized that accepting German hegemony on Europe was dangerous and that Germany had shown that it could not be trusted. Why should these Allied powers have put faith in a peace treaty when Hitler had already shown little concern with other agreements that bound Germany's behavior. Germany had already broken or unilaterally abrogated the Munich Pact, the German-Polish Nonaggression Treaty, the Anglo-German Naval Treaty, the Anti-Comintern Pact, and a host of other bilateral and international agreements made with Germany by 1939. Simultaneous to Hitler's peace offers to the West, he and his generals were already planning to abrogate the German-Soviet nonaggression pact and these efforts  accelerated after the Fall of France. There was nothing to indicate in either 1939 or 1940 that Hitler had changed and there was no rational cost-benefit ratio that favored an accommodating peace with Germany. 

*Was die Welt nicht wollte: Hitlers Friedensangebote 1933‚Äì1939*  tells us very little about the desires and motivations that lay behind the Third Reich's foreign policies. What Stieve does illuminate though is the perceived weaknesses of the war in these early stages among the German public. There is considerable evidence in the form of surviving diaries, letters, SD reports, and journalistic accounts that the war was not popular among the German public. Hitler's two offers of peace after  hostilities had commenced were mostly to shore up domestic support for a war that a number of Germans did not want. Painting the Allies as countries that had rebuffed Hitler's initiatives until he had no choice was a way to shift blame for starting the war on other nations. This exculpatory view of Hitler's foreign policy is the reason why Stieve's work has been translated and features prominently on neo-Nazi sites and other forms of Nazi apologia.

[17:04:36] Comment: dywt8sg by matirion : I do not believe that the risk is as big as the media suggests, and even if it is, then should that should not be a reason to not involve the police. There have been a few incidents, but people act like every time the police get involved with a person of color it ends up in a dead man or woman. Consider this; more people of color die in traffic accidents than by getting shot by a cop, so should we all stop using vehicles so that there won't be any traffic incidents involving them? Both of those situations only represent a fraction of the occurrences, and the real danger of them being killed is much lower than people seem to believe. People of color should not be exempt from the law just because there have been some incidents that involve people of color and cops. If they wish to be paranoid about it, then they should avoid breaking the law and if they do something illegal then they should expect the cops to be called. If they don't break the law and the cops are called on them, then that is a different story, but when they do break the law the risk is on them. The law is for everyone, not just for people who are white. posted to submission: CMV: The camera woman in this video is in the wrong, and there is no evidence that the accused woman accused of racism in the video was actually racially motivated.

Her weight cut is likely super dangerous and I am sure women's weight cutting methods follow the same protocols as men which shouldn't be how it is.

[17:05:38] Comment: dywt8t7 by nailattack : His pressure is pretty good. But I noticed practically every single time you got opened up by Bardock (like 3-4 times), you got hit with the same overhead. You could have honestly punished most of them with a 2H. Try to keep an eye out for same patterns within your opponent. The tricky part is going to be learning to recognize them and adapt to them immediately in the same match.

In the meantime, practice (always) blocking low and reacting high. Most overheads in this game are pretty damn slow so as long as you keep calm you should be able to react to the highs.  posted to submission: Can someone advice about what i'm doing wrong?

I presented him the facts. Meeting at my place, his place, or any place that involved our family or friends, didn't count as dates. That meant we went on 6 dates in the entire year of our relationship. I arranged 6 of those dates, and they were exclusivelly what I enjoyed and he died of boredom during. I gave him an ultimatum. Put in at least 50% or we're done.

Additionally, during our break up talk, he 1. Accidentally called me fat. 2. Actually meant it as I was really nice to cuddle. 3. You know, like *(insert name of a common friend we have that is literally twice my weight)*.

That's your opinion and your own prioritization. The pros include  preventing some instances of fatal disease and preventing a lot of infant and childhood suffering via UTI.

FGM victims are unable to experience orgasm. Thee is no such hard evidence of desensitization with circumcision, and even if there were, it is up to the parent to determine if the preventive medical benefits are worth it, not you, and not the government.

NA standards comes from company liabilities and regulations more so than what the vehicles can actually do.

[17:08:26] Comment: dywtk36 by TacThunder : It‚Äôs not an opinion. He outright stopped composing for orchestra and any other instrument when he hit 20 and left Poland. He knew he could only reach perfection by doing things his way, so he basically invented new genres and revolutionized piano writing. He only wrote 4 sonatas, and the rest were mostly works that were under 10 minutes. Had he been in better health, and lived another 20 years or so, maybe he would‚Äôve been pressured into writing for orchestra. I know he could have since he was one of the greatest geniuses, since even Scriabin mastered it in only several years. posted to submission: Who never wrote a symphony, but should have?

In 1919 Rolls-Royce acquired its first US manufacturing plant in Springfield, Massachusetts. Production began the following year. By 1923, Rolls-Royce presence in the U.S. was substantial. Rolls-Royce of America Inc. manufactured nearly 3000 Silver Ghosts and Phantoms before succumbing to the Great Depression.

[17:08:31] Comment: dywtk35 by paxtoncrawford : If there‚Äôs one EP IX plot line that TLJ unambiguously sets up is a mutiny / coup by Hux against Kylo.  In order to succeed he‚Äôs going to need help, and the KOR would be perfect.  I‚Äôd love to see overlapping plots in which Kylo is on the run from the FO and KOR, Rey is pursuing Kylo (maybe with Finn?) after self-exiling due to her onetime alliance with Kylo being revealed, and the war between the Rebellion and FO is coming to a head.  

It probably won‚Äôt be in the manner I‚Äôm suggesting, but I think with JJ at the helm there‚Äôs a decent chance we see the KOR at some point.  I mean, why not?  posted to submission: Hux and the Knights of Ren in Episode 9

[17:08:35] Comment: dywtk3e by zaldria : I think the Senju just faded into the regular population. The Uchiha seemed pretty into blood purity and marrying within the clan. We don't really get that vibe from any other clans from what I can remember. Also, the Senju don't have any special jutsu that stay within the clan like the Uchiha, Nara, Yamanaka, Akamichi, and Aburame. They'd be harder to notice in the village and in a fight. They were just extremely powerful ninja with very strong and ample chakara. Tsunade is the last Senju we know of, and that's only because she's the only granddaughter of Hashirama. Since they had no special family jutsu or kekkei genkai, they were probably happy to just fold into the population and think of the whole village as their new clan. The same thing happened to the Uzumaki, even before their village was destroyed. posted to submission: Which is the stronger clan: Uzumakis or Uchihas?

Hazard has done nothing, but that's because we haven't been able to keep hold of the ball or create anything. That has an awful lot to do with Cahill not being able to get the ball forward and Barkley being non existent in defense and not contributing positively, all be it with more touches than Hazard.  posted to submission: [Match Thread] Newcastle vs Chelsea - Premier League

I have no data on which to base an analysis of ‚Äòaverage‚Äô for duration. I can say with certainty, however, that my wife and I typically spend 1+ hours sexing it up together. And I use my body, toys, porn, dirty talk, and whatever else will get her off‚Äîwhich is really how we got to the whole swinging thing.

I certainly *can* get off in 5 mins. But my objective is usually to leave my wife wrung out with pleasure. Even with 20 years of practice I can‚Äôt do that in 5 minutes. :) posted to submission: My(27f) husband(29m) has completely changed since we had an encounter with another couple.

[17:10:52] Comment: dywtohu by NoxiousQuadrumvirate : Okay? I'm sorry that my illness and pathway to diagnosis doesn't conform to whatever story you think it should. 

Doctor's are never sure what's wrong, *I'm* not sure what's wrong. All I have are symptoms, and different people interpret them in different ways and assign me different treatments. So far, they all failed. Schizophrenia is one that fits well and the treatment set up has actually helped me. Maybe other people can walk into their GP's office and get their diagnosis set in stone within that first 15 minute appointment, but I didn't. Things were complicated and they still are. I have a history of abuse that muddies the waters beyond comprehension, and it's still open debate but that debate is not one you get to be a part of. You've shown yourself to be a vindictive, judgemental, and pretentious prick. You simply don't have any justification to try to diagnose me or to call into question the diagnoses I've been given. I leave that up to qualified professionals, and if they change their mind tomorrow and say that I have DID instead, I guess I'll have to accept that. Unfortunately, there isn't a simple blood test to tell me what I have and what I need to do to treat it. I don't fit neatly into a box, and so I end up shifting between them depending on whatever is the medical flavour of the month.  posted to submission: TIL the so-called 'Autism Epidemic' isn't an epidemic at all but rather an increase in reported incidents due to a growing awareness of autism and changes to the condition‚Äôs diagnostic criteria.

[17:11:52] Comment: dywtoii by tofustix : I was once camping in the Santa Barbara back country with a couple friends, about a 10 mile hike in from the trailhead. The last morning of our trip, as we were making breakfast and packing up our campsite, we heard voices on the hillside up above our camp. At first we thought it was a couple guys coming down the trail, but their voices didn't get louder or closer, and we realized they must have been watching us and talking to each other, not realizing we could hear them. 
After about an hour they came down the trail, two middle-aged white men with rifles and backpacks with antlers sticking out. One was short and stalky and one tall and slender. The short one came marching off the trail toward us and said in a gruff voice "So what kind of weed you guys smoking?" We had of course been smoking weed, but I didn't see how that was any of his business. My friend answered, "oh you know, just schwag, but we just finished it off," at which point he proceeds to bring a pipe out of his shirt pocket and exclaimed, "Well we'll just have to smoke mine then!" The tall and slender man still had not spoken and something just felt off. He passed the pipe to my two friends first, who both took a hit, and then to me and I refused, saying that I didn't smoke.
The short man then asked me to hold his backpack, which he slung off his back and basically threw at me. There were antlers sticking out the top and blood dripping out the bottom, and he asked me "how much do you think that weighs?" To which I responded "I don't know, maybe 35-40 pounds?" Apparently I was dead-on and he explained that they had butchered the deer in the backcountry to bring back the meat, which he shoved right in his backpack.
This is when they introduced themselves as Ralph and Keith, and proceeded to tell us that they had been childhood friends growing up in Santa Barbara, and used to hunt deer in the area as kids. Their whole lives they've met up for a hunting trip in the area every year. Keith (the slender quiet one) married a DA in SB County, and Ralph had moved up to the mountains outside Yosemite, married a "nice fat woman who baked" and walked the power lines through the mountains, inspecting for fallen tree branches and the like. They ended up being cool, if not weird, older dudes and I kind of wish I had smoked with them, but I think I made the right decision in the moment. posted to submission: [Serious] Campers of reddit, what is the scariest/creepiest/most disturbing thing that has happened to you in the woods?

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting fadeaways on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to James Harden. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love. posted to submission: I wish to speak to your moderator

The docs don't say it's deprecated and I'd wanted to go that route instead of `File Append` because I won't always know the contents of the file in order to use RegEx or StrReplace (the parameters of the xml wouldn't always be the same, like `ExtensionBundleId="com.my.test"` might not always be present to have `my.test` replaced in this same context, but I would know the line number and the full contents of the new line to replace the previous line with). posted to submission: How do I use File.WriteLine() to replace the current line without spilling into the next?

[17:13:40] Comment: dywtojy by Thriven : >I have a nissan primera 1995 the problem with this car is it turns off when i brake to make the car stop when i go above 25

Most likely transmission.

> ...and i can smell gas coming out from the exhaust 

Running too rich most likely. Is it overheating or running hot regularly? 

>...today i notest that when the radiator fan works my car was about to turn off while in park and it happened over and over 

What are your temps at? Could be a fan idle pulley needs to be replaced. It could be an electric thermostat that isnt appropriately reading for the fan to turn on. I have owned 5 nissans and to be honest I never had issues with the idle fan turning on as most of the vehicles I have owned and worked on were heat based. The fan sat on the water pump and as the car heated up, the water pump did as well and the idle fan clutch had a coil that would expand and engage the belt driven fan.

Ultimately it sounds like at some point its over heating but it shouldnt shut off because of it.

[17:15:58] Comment: dywtw2u by TheseRevolution : I want this same thing. A few meaningful texts, and short calls a day with my long\-distance guy. 

And he doesn't want the same anymore. When he was 'trying for me', he would be on the phone with me for 2\-3 hrs a day, with tons of texting. Now, he'll go a couple days without talking to me, and by the time he calls I'll be too upset to talk. The conversations lost meaning and he's always making excuses. I still remain hopeful, but I know I'm not going to have a good ending with this one.

I just need the consistency of having someone in my life. Sometimes a good morning text. If you send me a snap, don't make it a mass snap. Give me calls when you have time. FUCKING PICK UP MY CALLS. 

If it's really that big of an issue for you to give him that, just spare him the trouble. Because not hearing from you probably really hurts him.. posted to submission: My (22M) Boyfriend (27M) insists on chatting everyday, and demands a greeting every time. Is this normal?

[17:16:08] Comment: dywtw2z by Furious--Max : No.

Pits are aggressive because they were invented, trained, and used PURELY for blood sport for hundreds of years.

It doesnt always matter how well you train and how much you love them, because their underlying instinctual purpose is to kill for your entertainment. Those instincts can take over at any time. Obviously your bro wasnt an ideal owner.. but even people who do everything perfectly lose control of their pits. Often.

Its pretty funny how every single,  And i mean every single time a pit disfugres some kids face or eats granny - the owner says the samd thing EVERY SINGLE TIME.

It's like when a rich person buys a $100,000 car or rents out a hotel room for $1,000 in the penthouse per night.  If someone makes hundreds of millions of dollars, that $100,000 car to them is like me buying one for $10,000; $1,000 for a hotel room is me spending $100.

Today, for instance. I've been up for five hours, using my phone heavily for navigation, videos, podcasts, the works. I've been driving, so I'm in and out of different service areas. All of that, and I'm still at 86%. 

If it's not for you, it's not for you. I'm not trying to change your mind if it's made up. But the P2 is one heck of a phone.

I don't care who commits this crime, it's equally abhorrent. The difference is that this sort of behavior is all too common with ghetto blacks, and largely has to do with their cultural norms being repulsive.

It's not illegal in most of the United States to say "I don't like you working here because you're homosexual, you're fired" and to do exactly that. Lobbying groups - like the ones people want to donate money to - are working to change that.

Charter Communications, Inc. is an American telecommunications company that offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states, it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV. It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.

In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St.

I have had some of the same issues with therapists in my area. The only mental health facilities that my insurance covers is a Christian based service... I made sure to let the therapist know that I am an atheist and that god talk was not going to help me. He recommended that I see another guy because he wasn't going to be a good fit for me.

Hahhhh, love this. 

But! I've started seeing a lot more supportive bralette-hybrid sort of things, with real cups and bands, but still pretty and show-able. I got a SUPER cute bra from Intimissimi last summer that I wear under low-cut showy things like this. It's got a really high gore (so more coverage), and the WHOLE thing is covered in a substantial lace, so it looks purposeful and not like my underwear is showing by accident. 

I've also definitely worn a regular bra under a bralette, and it can work. But I agree, it never quite feels right.  posted to submission: How can you cover up a very low cut dress?

All they have done is alert intelligent Americans to their movement and allow us time to make everyone with half a brain aware of what is going on. It's time we take back this country.

A color picture is composed of  a red (1), a green (2) and a blue (3) channel. [These are true colors](https://i.imgur.com/ZUTCj1b.png) [Red -> Red, Green -> Green, Blue -> Blue].

[This is false color](https://i.imgur.com/XbPDtvI.png) [Red -> Blue, Green -> Green, Blue -> Red].

[17:24:04] Comment: dywu7rm by Metafee : Sure! Chico works primarily with kids with special needs. This includes kids with autism and various syndromes. He helps with bonding, creating social interactions and the learning of basic care abilities.

A therapy dog must not be afraid of humans or animals of any kind. He must be trained to not react negativity to various different behaviors those children may have. Some kids don‚Äôt know how to react to the feelings they have towards the dog. Some might bite the dog out of love. 

The kids participate in all the stages of care for the dog. They play with him, feed him, bath him, brush their teeth and sometimes they even insist in spending their own money to buy toys for the dog. This helps with a lot of things, from the sentiment of validation to the learning of some basic responsibilities. 

One good exemple of help in therapy is one time he played tug of War with one autistic child and another one came to help. This kind of social behavior is not normal for kids with autism. 

I have to go now but I might come back to tell more about it if you want.  posted to submission: Therapist Chico came to our class this morning with his owner to tell about his job.

[17:25:25] Comment: dywugo7 by Dregoraz : I have a sincere hatred for the rising rush mechanic.

It looks gorgeous and in that sense, I love that it exists, but it's too accessible. It kills all kind of tactics with choosing cards. All people do is just rush the cards with dragon balls, no matter how illogical their useage is.

Not only that, you can use it multiple times in a match.

For a OHKO mechanic that relies on a rock-paper-scissor mechanic, it's too common.

I mean, why should you actually go for other cards other than dragon ball cards? There's no benefit to doing anything else.

I don't like it. posted to submission: Soo now that we sort of had a chance to play

[17:26:43] Comment: dywugpf by xLatency : Maybe if it had a certain time gated restriction like limit breaking. What I mean by that is that Bamco releases limit breaking for older units first and as time goes on, and a new unit gets older, they eventually get a limit break to keep them relevant. If this ability transfer system were to be implemented into older units first and then slowly work its way to newer units I could see it working better. This way it might revitalize OG units and make them not so useless like maybe adding ‚Äúincreased jutsu multiplier by x‚Äù or something along those lines. Then maybe those older units could get two transfers instead of just one. posted to submission: [Fluff] Abilities inheritance? Game improvement series#2

[17:27:30] Comment: dywumj7 by Thadrea : They probably cannot require you to sign a different contract.

A contract is a "meeting of the minds" between two parties that exchange consideration. Being that you remain legally the same person when you change your name, any existing contracts are still valid and still enforceable.

They can, if they wish, ask you to consent to the changes in your existing agreement (e.g. by presenting you with it and asking you to agree) but unless your existing agreement permits them to amend the agreement unilaterally they cannot compel you to accept changes until the next time your contract is up for renewal. posted to submission: Changes to Contract of Employment

[17:27:38] Comment: dywumjd by will_arnett : If they are survivalists they should kill him to further their chances of survival in the future. They know he is dangerous, they beat him. Why not kill him now that you have the chance?

I also don't like cliche√© good vs evil tropes. But that explenation does not justify leaving Bonedrewed alive IMO. Like, ooh Prushka liked him so lets forgive him mutilating hundreds of kids and that he might follow us down to Iblu or that he might stand in their way if they by some mircle start working their way up out of the abyss.

If he somehow threatens their survival, just end him. It doesn't have to be motivated by revenge or moraly justified. It can be just and act of survival. But they do nothing of that. Because a girl they knew for 5 minutes liked him. Motivations are all over the place. Action good, characters bad. Or we don't have complete information.

[17:27:42] Comment: dywumjg by ymOx : There is, but it's very weak so you'll get players of very different skills than your own; surely you have noticed this. But imo it's better to have weak match making than none. I'm only in plat but I still get GCs every now and then. Not often, but it happens.

But the point I was going to make is; yes you need to play better players to learn, but at the same time they can't be infinitely better than you. A bronze player will learn something from a gold player but will probably not learn a lot from being hard rolled by a GC. posted to submission: Reporting for unfair matchmaking

I use mine with wide mouth jars to store hops in the freezer and it works out pretty nice. If you want to order bulk spices by the pound and use the sealer to store excess, that makes sense.  They might even come in a bag that you can reseal. 

Sealing up partially used used little spice jars inside plastic sounds pretty awkward and you‚Äôre not going to suck the air out of the jars. Likewise, sealing up small amounts of spices into the vac bags will be awkward as well because the spices will get into the crevices in the plastic that allow the air to escape during sealing.  posted to submission: Thinking about buying a fancy vacuum sealer, and I'm trying to find ways to justify it to my SO.

[17:28:33] Comment: dywumkc by Shelliez : LITERALLY just went through this. Found a guy looking for a relationship. He told me on our first meet up that he had just gotten out of a 2 year relationship a month or so prior because there was "no connection." Started getting to know eachother for a few weeks. About a month in, I'm really feeling it and I really like him and I think we're headed somewhere. He started asking me questions about the future and inviting me to future events in advance and taking a big interest in me. I feel this connection I've never felt with anyone in my past. THEN out of the blue he deletes me off facebook and starts being short with me. Said it was cause his ex was "nosey" and he told her hes dating. I gave him a week because I knew he was going through a lot in his life, and we started seeing each other again. I still felt a connection but he was being spacey and didn't initiate intimacy anymore. In this time he also started meeting my friends knowing full well? that a couple weeks later he was going to drop me. He said he wanted to be friends only, didn't feel a connection and wanted to be platonic. I think hes trying to put me on the backburner while he goes back to his ex. I agreed at first but then his ex purposefully made some photos public on facebook of them together. I told him I didn't want to be friends with a liar (said they're friends and this has nothing to do with her). I'm so mad he wasted my time and energy. But also I'm really sad because I truly wanted it to work out. Men suck and dating is exhausting :( posted to submission: Why do people do this crap on dates?

[17:29:01] Comment: dywuqiy by MundaneCyclops : Personally, I think your conversation needs to start with your husband.  You two need to have an honest and open discussion on where you two stand on this topic.  You need to setup a method of communication, you need to setup expectations, and boundaries, for each other, and others in your life, like your MIL.  

You and your husband need to come to grips on what religion means to you two, and where you see yourselves now, in two years, in 5 years, in 10... etc.  This will help you plan things and make sure there are no surprises in your relationship.  

The turf war you have with your MIL is purely a control issue, unfortunately it's against a backdrop of Faith.  So you're kind of in a tough spot here.  You will need your husband to back you up on this one.  This is critical.  This kind of control also happens often, where MILs tend to still try to control their son's lives.  My sister had a similar situation, she in essence put her foot down and defined boundaries with the help of her husband.  

Also, speak with your children, speak with them openly and without judgement about religion.  Don't necessarily tell them what you believe, but ask them questions that will force them to think deeper about the meanings of certain things.  Make them think about how they know something is true and what it means to look for evidence.  That's probably your best short term strategy against indoctrination.  

Hope this helps, and best of luck.

[17:30:27] Comment: dywuqkq by Chazzyphant : Well, first and foremost, is *is* a form of social shaming. You're correct. And this behavior from young, attractive, oblivious women does occur to "awkward" or less than conventionally "hot" guys more than "hot" guys. You're right about that. You are certainly not the first to stumble on this observation. 

Just to give you a view from the female side of it: Do you know how many times men have pushed past me, insulted me, or ignored me to "get to my hot friends". Dozens. Do you know how many times a cute guy has had an amazing conversation with me and then biffed off to hit on a "hot" chick at a bar? Dozens. How many times a male friend has cried on my shoulder about his bitchy, cheating, "psycho" girlfriend he for some reason can't break up with--because oh, wait, she's "hot"? Dozens. And I'm an average/cute/pretty woman, I'm just not a "10". Imagine what it's like for "the female version of the nice guy". 

But I would like to attempt to widen your view on a couple other things here: 
Young women who are conventionally attractive are at the height of their social power, and are *not* a great "target" for a shy, socially awkward man to approach, despite their admitted attractiveness. Especially in a group where other women behave out of character perhaps due to drinking and are more harsh than warranted. If you are approaching "hotties" at the bar in a group of her friends, you're Doing It Wrong. 

Furthermore, I'm not sure what the importance of a "reputation" is in today's society. I could be myopically focused on the US, AUS, and Western Europe, but in those countries, there kind of...is no such thing as a "reputation" for a young man. Older people in the public eye, sure. But someone giggling with her friends and calling someone a cruel name is not the end of the world. 

Additionally, and probably most importantly, your Grandmother is not a good source of information for several reasons:

She's older, and her memories and answers are biased, both in your favor, and in the positive. She's not going to share stories of scary sexual encounters with her young grandson. 

The entire culture was different in her day. Women were financially and socially dependent on mens' good favor. Of *course* you're going to smile and flip your hair and "go along" if the man "flirting" with you is your boss, your brother in law, your pastor, the head of the school your kid goes to, and so on. 

Additionally to that, many women didn't go to bars, or weren't single for most of their adult life. So the experience of being hit on by every guy in the room and being treated like a means to an end over and over was not part of their lives. 

Finally, "flirting" implies a *mutual interest*. Naturally, Grandma and her friends recall "flirting" positively because it IS positive. Being catcalled, approached over and over by men, and so on, gets old. Fast. 

Moving on, if you, a man, want to "get to know" a woman because she's hot/attractive/beautiful/pretty, really examine that. 'I want to get to know you' is a painfully thin disguise for "I want to put in the minimum amount of time I have to before I can start pestering you for sex". 

Why aren't you approaching *every* interesting looking person to "get to know them"? Because you probably don't want to "f" 50 year old moms, man-bun male yoga instructors, chubby/dorky/not-hot/weird female sci fi fans or 80 year old male philosophy professors, no matter how "interesting" they may be. Be honest. Women aren't fools. They know very well when a man is biding his time and hoping he will get a shot.  posted to submission: CMV: Calling guys creepy is a form of social shaming

[17:31:21] Comment: dywuv5j by zwolfd33 : I understand your point. It's implied that professional fighters have to make weight; knowing your opponent needs the money and blatantly deciding not to make weight by 5% total body mass is skeezy as fuck. You go in with no fatigue from attempting a weight cut and a massive weight advantage.

At least with steroids the stigma is, it's illegal and and awfulnthing to do, if you are caught you will be punished.

Dern weighed in well over the limit and then it was up to her opponent if the fight still happens. ( surrender show money, training camp expenses, etc.)

Although I agree steroid use is worse than intentionally missing weight; not by much man. UFC is so desperate for a female star (any star) she's allowed to  be unprofessional and still gets paid. Her missing weight would be the same as a 205er toppling the scales at 220, in a sport that is determined by cardio, technique and strength to weight ratio, weighing in a full 5% more mass than your opponent is a HUGE competitive advantage. posted to submission: [Spoiler] Mackenzie Dern vs Amanda Cooper

[17:32:14] Comment: dywuv6n by PersonalDave : I mean, I suspect at 40, I have some hearing loss anyhow -- in my late 20s I developed tinnitus, and had my hearing tested, everything was in the normal range, although I noticed a very slight dip at roughly 4khz, which made sense to me as I'd played music for years with some very loud bands.  So it wouldn't surprise me if some of that has worsened with age (even if you're cautious with your hearing, there are just too many incidental noise exposures if you live in a city).

But yeah, I tried the app a few times, and my sense of being able to hear both the high and low end was more variable. So perhaps the app is most accurate when monitored a doctor or audiologist (the idea is that the app could be used to help under serviced areas).

What do make of their "age norms" that I mentioned?  Or are those really even useful in audiology? posted to submission: Trying out hearing test app -- thoughts?

I was in the midst of a Fallout/Icewind Dale/Planescape phase and **loved** this game. The idea of magic and technology being anathema to one another is a theme that I bring into many d&d games that I run mainly because of this game.  
  
The fiddly bits can be rough. It takes patience and an acceptance that many were running this thing on Win95 when it came out. I keep it installed on my systems and go back to it every couple of years.

These rocks were laid down in the cretaceous period, then uplifted and rotated by tectonic plate movement so the layers are perpendicular to gravity. The different colours are caused by different compounds trapped between the sand.

[17:33:32] Comment: dywuv7t by The_Mushroominator : Lots of things will work.   People often use Tyvek sheeting, often from waterproof mailing envelopes (free at post office in U.S.).      There are tons of other low cost options though.   I like freer gas exchange and use a modified vacuum cleaner bag.    Hoover Platinum Collection type Q bags are made from a synthetic material that works perfectly in my impulse sealer.    I cut two sheets as large as I can match, put them back to back with the shiny material facing outward (there are many layers in each sheet, some less durable than others, make sure the exterior of the bag is the exterior of your filter for both sides) and start sealing parallel lines about 3/4 of an inch apart.    Once I've gotten all the way across the sheet I turn it 90 degrees and do it all over again creating a bunch of square filters.    Cut down the centers of the heat sealed lines to get those filters and start gluing them to your lids with silicone.    I get hundreds of filters from a single bag.    They will outlast the lids you glue them to.    But that is a lot of B.S. that some people wouldn't do.

There are also filters you can get from mushroom supply companies that are cut specifically for both large and small mouthed jars.   There are cellulose fiber ones (thick) and synthetic ones.

[17:34:15] Comment: dywv196 by hasabooga : I am, and I also said that last summer was absolutely awful, though Morata could still work out and Rudiger/Giroud haven't been bad for the role they've been brought in for.

And again, are we saying that Conte had absolutely NO say in any of these signings? I cannot believe, even with a club like Chelsea, that Conte's input was not sought for these players, and that the club deliberately ignored him.

Selling Matic was indefensible, but who the hell knows if Conte thought Bakayoko was ready to step up? Did Conte identify Drinkwater as someone who could bring in experience in midfield? 

Similarly, did Conte seriously expected Chelsea to match the ¬£100m total package that Utd were offering Everton for Lukaku? Morata for almost half that made far more sense (and lets not forget it was Mourinho, not the board, who decided he was never worth a game).

The board are undoubtedly culpable, but lets not pretend Conte is an innocent bystander in all this who can't avoid a 3-0 (could be worse yet) defeat at Newcastle with the squad he's got. posted to submission: BREAKING: Zenit St Petersburg terminate Roberto Mancini's contract by mutual consent.

I say save the dream for this down the road where you can control the variables (no roommates, roommates friends/study partners coming and going) and simply offer makeup advice if the people need it. You can always offer to go to their rooms and help out or charge a small fee for that. But thinking a group of people who rarely wear makeup and in an uncontrolled environment is a viable business option is not likely.

[17:35:52] Comment: dywv1b5 by yvchao : The sky was bright yesterday. There were no dark clouds in the sky, so the stars were bright. I heard that there were nine stars that were even there. I did not see them anyway. In many martial arts novels, Jiuxing Renzhu must have major events. Unfortunately, it is only in the novel. The reality is that it is scientific. I slept very early last night and it's early to wake up today. Touched the bedside mobile phone, did not find it, it seems not put out in the bag, this must not be late. After I got up, where did I have been shocked for two minutes. Why did I get sick at the hospital last night and I was sent to the hospital? It's impossible. I can't remember anything at all. Forget it or ask someone to ask, and don't know what time it is. At this time, the door stood alone, wearing white clothes, it should be a nurse. How could I be here? What happened last night, when the nurse touched my head and his condition got worse, Dr. Han was not saying that he was already recovering. Ase, how do you recover your arm strength now, and feel that your amnesia has not improved. I looked around wonderingly. There was no other person. Was he talking to me? Without waiting for me to speak, he pointed to the training equipment next to me and told me to try the 10,000 pounds first. Are you kidding me, i am a normal human. I spoke to me, picking up the large object by the way and saying that it was impossible to pick it up. What, it's not that great at all. Isn't it a block bubble? The nurse told me that it was OK. It was a good recovery. Come on and you will be discharged soon. I sent him away with doubt and helped the next wall. The wall was pushed by me. God, what did I do? Did the real power increase? Why am I here, who am I, where is this, who are they, what's wrong with my body, all the problems come with it. After that, I fell into a coma. . . posted to submission: Writing Task: Monday Public Speaking (5th Week)

[17:36:56] Comment: dywv6cv by djturdbeast : I got mine on eBay. Just search "new 3ds xl bottom plate" and then maybe add your color at the end. Some are used, but get the new one. 
Note: the part you find may include the top plate as well. This one is a little trickier to replace (compared to the bottom) since you have to dig out the 4 screws that are hidden above and below the speaker holes on the display.

Also, it slides off kinda funny (if you're not used to tearing down small devices like smart phones).

 I had no trouble replacing mine, but I repaired smart phones for 5 years so it was cake. But if your top plate is fine, I'd recommend leaving it alone.

If you'd like I can PM you an eBay link to a good part. Just tell me what color/design your n3dsxl is, yo. posted to submission: Serial Number Sticker
[17:36:57] Comment: dywv6cu by Kurisu789 : In Heroes Clair is mediocre. Cordelia has an optimized offensive stat line of 35/35 and Firesweep Lance nullifies her lack of defensive stats when attacking. Clair has 26/36, so at base Cordelia has 9 more Attack in exchange for 1 less speed. In order to utilize Rhomphaia Clair must give up the Firesweep effect and it only has 1 more Mt than Firesweep Lance does. Which wouldn‚Äôt be so much of a problem, except instant KO retaliation is extremely common and Clair has the defense of a cardstock standee. 

Shigure is also downright faster than she is, and has 7 more points of attack, AND fits into a higher Arena scoring bin due to his trainee BST. There are so many good Lance fliers in the game and Clair faces extreme competition for the slot, unlike say Caeda. Even with Rhomphaia‚Äôs dual effectiveness and Flashing Blade refine there‚Äôs really not much she brings to the table other Lance fliers cannot accomplish better due to some combination of better stat spreads and how strong inheritable lances are (Firesweep, Harmonic, Berkut‚Äôs). posted to submission: Delthea by @khe_mn

Judging a person for what their political ideas are ("liberalism is a disease", "conservatives are all racists") rather than debating the ideas themselves is part of how we got into this shithole we are currently in.

But yeah increase the time by like 10 minutes at least each time, but then also throw in some reeeeeeeally short ones too, like go take the trash out with him in there and stuff. Do those randomly. Dogs will figure out patterns quick so if you don‚Äôt mix it up a bit it won‚Äôt be as effective. But definitely make the door situation a positive experience. If you tie the door to the experience of getting a treat for long enough, eventually you can ditch the treat and she‚Äôll have enough fond memories of getting treats that she won‚Äôt mind you leaving. 

I‚Äôm finding ownership fun and challenging. Its definitely a change in lifestyle, and one that, for the time being until the school year ends in two weeks, is not super ideal. But it‚Äôll get better, and like i said before, mine seems to be doing pretty well under the circumstances.  posted to submission: How to handle leaving pup to go back to work?

[17:39:43] Comment: dywvauy by Tzivos : The air stands silently still for just a moment as the force of your swing explodes outward, sending the Calamitous Cap'n crashing to the floor of the deck, limp and lifeless. A wave of sickly green energy surges over the Cap'n's body for a moment before engulfing it entirely and erupting in a shower of grist.

# Victory!

* Gain 7000 exp

* Gain:

 > 3186 T1 Grist

 > 976 T2 Grist

 > 307 T3 Grist

 > 94 T4 Grist

 > 37 T5 Grist

 > 14 T6 Grist

As the grist continues to flow, the rain quickly begins to let up, the dark clouds above slowly parting as the sun's rays shine through once more. Where the Cap'n's body laid, only the book he carried remains, sitting amidst pools of various colored hues of blood, shining uncomfortably bright in the sunlight, and dismembered body parts.

[17:39:49] Comment: dywvav6 by rigger-seeing : I entire life I've had lucid dreams. While in a dream one night a hooded figure appears and tells me that I am in an alternate universe and I am ready to begin training.The people around me suddenly disappeared. I can't remember anymore. I suspended in the air. I feel that the universe revolves around me. It seems that nothing in the world can arouse my inner desire. Day by day. I'm hanging there. I don't have to do anything. My mind and spirit roam in the universe. I don't know if it was the whirlpool of the universe that attracted me, or that I simply couldn't give up the dream mirror. I hear a legend that only six Infinity stones that control power, time, space, soul, reality and soul can help me return to the real world. I assembled my army and began an endless journey. A constant battle in the universe. Shuttling through the galaxy. Gradually I forgot the time. I don't know how many eras past. I've finally assembled six powerful Infinity gems. Their power is unimaginable. The person who owns  all of them can destroy or disappear half the universe with only one ring of his finger. But I don't want to do it. I just want to escape this boundless universe and find myself in the past. I control their power,seeing the true meaning of the universe. I control power, time, space, reality, soul and soul. And use them to create a wormhole. Seeing my masterpiece, I felt so happy for the first time in billions of years. I stepped into a wormhole. My strength, body and spirit have begun to fade away. I slowly didn't know anything. I was lying in my own bed when I opened my eyes again. I know I've got my memories back. But I can not forget the feeling that lost in the dream for billions of years. posted to submission: Writing Task: Monday Oral English (5th Week)

[17:39:51] Comment: dywvav9 by ekot1234 : If the topic of sex comes up, I mention that I got tested after my last partner and ask if they would get tested and let me see the results too Sometimes they ask why, and I say that I like to be 100% safe. Usually the guy is either indifferent to it, already got tested after his last partner (my favorite type), or won‚Äôt do it. If they won‚Äôt do it, he isn‚Äôt worth my time. 

I don‚Äôt sugar coat stuff like this. If you‚Äôre having sex, you should be responsible and get tested after ever partner. If you can‚Äôt afford to go through your insurance, planned parenthood can do it for very cheap or nothing at all depending on your financial situation. I even offer to pay for half if they couldn‚Äôt afford it cause I need to know if he has anything. I‚Äôm not risking anything. 

If he won‚Äôt do it or gives me attitude about it, he isn‚Äôt worth shit.  posted to submission: Dear Ladies, I got a date next Wednesday. I am contemplating about exchanging STD results before taking the relationship into intimate. Would it be very offensive to ask a date to exchange STI results?

The latest know cutoff \(CA blitz\) for 1\-10&#37; for new players was 84'100. For veterans \- 218'000.

The cutoff is evergrowing, so you are looking for at least 90K to make it top 10&#37;. posted to submission: Is 180k enough for 1-10%?

[17:42:31] Comment: dywvf3j by usagimegumi : See the At Will can and has been used to invalidate the notice clause. I know this because I just finished studying it.  State laws can affect this but each states at will laws alter the way the contact is handled. Contract law is a messy place but certain clauses of contracts can be considered invalid based on case law and legislation.  It helps to look it up. You can't claim the entire contract is always valid without looking at each state. Which is what I suggested.  posted to submission: Changes to Contract of Employment

He set a few fastest laps after his spin, but in total didn't get closer  to Vettel. He alternated between fastest laps and slow laps.

[17:43:48] Comment: dywvf4b by ChildofChaos : When they talk, they normally talk about the same things. It's like they have a consistent point of view and everything comes from there. 

It seems like they all tend to have some kinda different way of looking at it, but they have found the principles or ideas they believe in and they allow everything to run from there.

Watch interviews of people you respect and look up too and they talk about the same things again and again, no matter what the question is etc, they tend to come back to the same few ideas and link that to everything.

People that don't have it together tend to be lacking in this. 

I think this is huge. But I could be wrong, but it's the only thing i've noticed, because there are all sorts of ideas or different ways of doing stuff, it seems more important to really have picked one, stay with it and truly believe it. posted to submission: What do you notice most about that person who "has it all together"?

[17:46:57] Comment: dywvmgh by Oneill_SG1 : They meant to say Volume Limiter. On the Arctis Pro \+ Gamedac it is called gain on the wireless it is Volume limiter.

From their FAQ:

1. Press the main knob to enter the main menu
2. Scroll down to Options and select
3. Scroll down to Vol Limiter and select
4. Switch the Vol Limiter setting from Yes \(default\) to No

This does help the white noise somewhat but it makes the max volume too low. posted to submission: Another Arctis Pro Wireless white noise/hiss thread
[17:46:58] Comment: dywvmgi by Accursedimmortal : I played it and sold it. I've been selling all games these days since I never replay them, even God of War so it's not a mark against the game. 

First the combat is way better than the first. The graphics is improved to the point where it looks like a Pixar film. The game was mostly easy throughout. Though it has an incredibly hard end game. 

The downside is the game is too formulaic. It's too predictable, help one of the kings and then destroy a kingmaker. The story doesn't surprise or give us a grand adventure. One of the reasons I loved Xenogears and FFVII was because of random story elements.

In other words, how do existing solutions look like and how big is the problem this is attempting to solve, independent of any proposed solutions (blockchain or otherwise)?

I'll be honest and say that I'm biased against a lot of blockchain "solutions" because they seem to care way more about the answer than truly understanding the question in the first place. This makes me really suspicious of them in the first place. Can you show a counterexample, where a blockchain organization has taken the time to establish expertise in their application domain, constrain the problem, understand alternatives, and rationally conclude that---given all the myriad trade-offs in any solution---blockchain is the best approach for reasons X, Y, and Z? posted to submission: Buterin joins r/buttcoin real quick to clear up that his stuff doesnt suck any worse than anybody else's stuff

The issue is that the whole government, and the opposition are using it to score points against each other, they are only interested in protecting their own skin, and ensuring that the Brexit we get extends the gap between rich and poor.

Nobody dare stick their hand up and say what a good majority of the country now know - including those that voted leave, that Brexit was a farce of biased media and lies. 

Without any kind of deal, this country will be on its knees, but those who are supposedly in charge do not care, they have enough money - and stand to make more if Brexit means we can eradicate the NHS and anything else we can privatise.  posted to submission: Theresa May urges public to 'trust me' to deliver Brexit amid increasingly bitter cabinet rows

[17:49:50] Comment: dywvxl7 by dryerasecalendar : Aside from the fact that this conversation is based around the fact that you said you would not choose to get rid of your psychiatric conditions if someone could push a button and make them disappear... that doesn't really answer my question. 

I am well aware of how difficult it is to live with psychiatric conditions, and I don't define my identity around them. You don't need to focus 100% on other things- that would be counterproductive to treatment, since awareness of your symptoms is the only way you can begin to diminish them. 

If someone asks you to talk about yourself, is the only thing you can come up with: "I'm WhenTheDeadComeHome and I have mood swings and compulsive thoughts?"

I hope not. If it is, I pity you. If it's not, why not build your identity around literally anything else? Obviously there is no magic button, but choosing to focus on your illness as the whole of your identity is cutting yourself off at the knees.  posted to submission: Eradicate? JFC

Do you even realize how ridiculous that sounds?

Especially when considering that the numbers don't back up your position at all. [Infinity War is currently the fifth highest grossing film of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_films), where the original iron man didn't even make the list. The people *objectively* enjoy Infinity War, so you can try to *make out* your minority opinion to be objective, but it absolutely isn't. In terms of statistics, in-universe reasoning, and loyalty to the original character, you are wrong.

So his title should be something along the lines of ‚ÄúMy thoughts on what‚Äôs in the secret bunkers‚Äù or something along those lines. It‚Äôs not, however, it‚Äôs some bullshit implying cool exclusive content, therefore clickbait. And saying it‚Äôs not as bad as the free vbucks videos is not an excuse.

[17:54:23] Comment: dyww60l by sneakyequestrian : Something that ended up happening in a campaign i played in is that both weapons, components, and focuses were regulated by the kingdom. You could only buy material components if you were part of a kingdom certified mercenary guild.

And every mage is required at birth (if born magical, or when they graduate mage school) to be magically marked. That mark acted like a social security number or a fingerprint, no 2 mages had the same mark, and whenever you casted magic it would leave a copy of that mark in the air, but invisible without a certain spell, for a certain amount of time.

Obviously there were ways to get around not being marked (druids living out in the woods, sorcs whos parents never got them marked, warlocks being warlocks) but being a mage without a mark was illegal and if you were caught doing magic without a mark you could be arrested.

[17:54:53] Comment: dyww60x by dethb0y : > LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces police have arrested a man suspected of severely beating his 15-week pregnant girlfriend, causing her to suffer a miscarriage.
> 
> Timothy Trejo-Vigil, 25, of the 2400 block of Lester Avenue, is charged with a second-degree felony count of attempted murder; two counts of aggravated battery against a family member using a deadly weapon; two counts of aggravated battery causing great bodily harm; and one count of injury to a pregnant woman. Trejo-Vigil also faces misdemeanor counts of battery against a household member and animal cruelty.
> 
> Police said they received a report at about 9 a.m. Thursday of an injured 22-year-old woman at a residence on Lester Avenue. Police said they learned the woman was Trejo-Vigil‚Äôs girlfriend of five years, and she lived there with Trejo-Vigil and his mother. The woman initially indicated she was attacked by two intruders who broke in through a window and tried to steal a TV and a laptop computer, police said.
> 
> The woman was transported to Memorial Medical Center and then airlifted to University Medical Center of El Paso. Trejo-Vigil had left the home just prior to police being called, police said.
> 
> Investigators said the 22-year-old woman‚Äôs story of being attacked by intruders was a ruse conceived by her and Trejo-Vigil. They also learned that Trejo-Vigil was known to have a history of domestic abuse against the same woman.
> 
> LCPD investigators said that sometime Wednesday, the couple got into a physical domestic dispute where Trejo-Vigil struck the woman several times. Investigators believe Trejo-Vigil used a heavy metal pipe and possibly a broken broom handle to severely beat the woman. The victim also had several human bite marks to her body, and multiple stab wounds to her knees and arms, police said. She suffered a broken jaw, broken nose and a large open wound to her forehead.
> 
> At the UMC intensive care unit, medical professionals determined the woman was 15-weeks pregnant and had experienced a still-birth as a result of the physical trauma she suffered.
> 
> Police believe Trejo-Vigil‚Äôs mother was home most of the time but claimed she did not hear or know anything about the incident. Police also found a cat locked in a small pet carrier, inside a closet. The pet carrier was soaked in urine and the cat had no access to food or water.
> 
> Trejo-Vigil was located and arrested Friday afternoon. He‚Äôs being held without bond at the Dona Ana County Detention Center. The investigation is ongoing and additional charges are possible. posted to submission: Man suspected of beating pregnant girlfriend, causing miscarriage

Kyle is a bulldog but still has his limits, too slow for quick gaurds and too small for big gaurds

DeMar - always been slow laterally he can only gaurd guys his size and is pretty bad off ball.

Ibaka - Ibaka has his moments but is functionally a center now. Can't reliably gaurd the perimeter and gets bodied by big centers. Poor rebounder doesn't help for small ball too

JV - tries his hardest but his physical limitations are just too much doesn't have the defensive IQ to make up for it either posted to submission: Daily Discussion/Free Talk - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[17:58:41] Comment: dywwg8i by RemorsefulWhim : I honestly think that having the shared wallet is fine, especially since it would cause headaches when using MP as a drop-in/drop-out feature if people weren't around when big crops got cashed in. That said, I think one thing that might work is having an extra option besides the one which modifies MP income; a setting for what percentage of a day's income is divided between the players, and how much gets funneled to a communal storage that could be accessed from the community center or a piggy bank as you suggest. That way you could from the outset decide between players things like if you have to pay for upgrades out of your own pocket, or letting the people who handle the more boring chores withdraw a bit extra from the storage on a week by week basis, or any number of bizarre caveats that can come up from playing with others.

Of course, all of this brings up a question that you didn't really cover in your post: how WOULD the game decide how to split the money if everyone had separate wallets as well as a shared and/or private stashes? More than whether or not the game should have something like this, how could it be implemented in a way that couldn't inevitably be gamed or exploited by someone? posted to submission: (Multiplayer) Shared Money and Wallet problem

[17:59:16] Comment: dywwg98 by i_am_ghost7 : first off, yes many minimum wage workers do not make enough to live on. I would argue that many are still young enough to live with their parents to reduce costs and I believe in helping others. But they do need to realize it is their responsibility to learn a valuable skill. Minimum wage jobs exist because they do not require many valuable skills and just about anyone can do it. I would argue that minimum wage jobs actually give people a chance who may otherwise be homeless.

I remember hearing a story from an asian-american. He said his mother immigrated across from asia. She knew very little english. Had no valuable skills. She moved to America to build a better life. She took responsibility and worked a minimum wage janitorial job while going to school and learning english. She wanted to give her son a good life here. After several years, she got better paying jobs (a doctor or lawyer by the end iirc) and was able to speak fluent enlgish. And now her son was raised to speak english and be educated and lives a good life working in his own field. He believes 100% in individuals taking responsibility for themselves. They did not rely on the government.

>There has never been true horizontal communism in existence

exactly my point! If we were able to achieve the idealized vision of what communism was meant to be then a lot more people would be on board.

and yes, certain rich are still corrupt, but they are not murdering millions or some other crazy shit. And you are forgetting about the rich that choose to do good! Bill and Melinda Gates and many other wealthy people put a significant amount of their time, money, effort, and resources into charities in an attempt to make the world a better place. They didn't cheat or scam their way to earn their fortune either. They sold a product that tens of millions of people wanted/needed in their lives and willingly paid for in return for the services. posted to submission: CMV: Museums and other places of historical significance should be funded no matter the profit they make

[17:59:43] Comment: dywwg9r by Aubzycake76 : Penelope her birthday was actually May 4th ( He named her )first appeared in utero in a dream, we discussed everything from what religion to raise her and everything. The first time I saw her she was in a white and purple stripped onsie and Simon was the happiest I‚Äôd seen him in a long while. He was going through this crazy biological clock thing, Jeremy came later and was a surprise. Penelope is a wild child, bold and talkative, she is going through a biting phase right now. Jeremy is quiet and afraid of his own shadow, we‚Äôve both noticed he has turned 4 and doesn‚Äôt speak, he communicates with his body language and expressions, he tends to cling to Simon with a little worried expression in his face. Simon worries that Jeremy has some sort of anxiety issue or something although he has no reason to be scared or worried. I have grown to love them both but still struggle with both fear of being a parent and guilt for not accepting any responsibility for them. Simon adopted two more kids, Aiden and Dakota he no longer has his empty nest.  posted to submission: I don‚Äôt know if anyone has experienced this.

[17:59:59] Comment: dywwga5 by Poutine_My_Mouth : I did it a bit differently than videos online, but here‚Äôs what I did:

1. Have her go in a *down*. Click & treat.

2. Some dogs do a relaxed *down*, where they kind of lean on one hip - use this to your advantage. Lure her with a treat at her nose, moving it slowly behind her back toward the direction of the relaxed hip, until she falls fully on her side. Click & treat, and keep doing this until she gets the idea.

3. Fade the lure as soon as you can, and use your hand to lure her into the *down/side* position. Click & treat. Do this a bunch of times. Add your cue word as they‚Äôre doing the behavior. You can also change your luring hand signal to a gun signal if you want.

4. Put your dog in a *down* and wait until they offer the *side* behavior, saying the cue word and using your hand signal while they‚Äôre doing the behavior, then click & treat. Do this a bunch times, also.

5. Once your dog has the trick down from a *down* positions try doing it from a *sit* position, so the dog learns to generalize the behavior.

Remember to praise your dog a lot, and click for little victories. This can be challenging for dogs to learn because it involves shaping in a lot of little steps more than capturing a natural behavior. Little victories will build confidence in the dog and they‚Äôll want to keep offering behaviors for you if you‚Äôre excited about it. Training progress happens when you ‚Äúforget‚Äù to click, so don‚Äôt be afraid to wait your dog out while they think about what behavior you want them to do next to get them to offer more of the behavior you‚Äôre looking for. I think there are a lot of great training tutorials for this online, and they would be a great resource, too. Their explanation would be better because then you can actually see the dog in action.

Good luck!!

[18:00:19] Comment: dywwgac by oneelectricsheep : I don‚Äôt think your bone example is really correct. It‚Äôs more of a side effect of how bone grows and behaves in the body. The ends of your long type bones is thicker because it‚Äôs a different type of bone with a different function. There‚Äôs plenty of joints where the bone isn‚Äôt thick like the pubic symphysis or your hip joint where the ball can break off relatively easily. Generally though if you get hit around the joint it‚Äôs going to destroy a lot of soft tissue that‚Äôs not going to heal right ever.

[18:01:52] Comment: dywwlnk by haldonstout33 : Honestly, I think she's probably just really into Sci-fi and space. She totally has that vibe. "Space Song", etc. You know, she said she would love to do soundtracks for films a long time ago and she mentioned science fiction. In a recent interview she said she would welcome doing those kinds of projects and so forth. It would be amazingly interesting to  hear her and Alex compose a score for a science fiction film or a fantasy one of these days, though maybe later in life. I intuitively am getting the feeling she is ready to take a longer break from touring soon, though my intuition is only a feeling. Either way, I hope she is taking good care of herself. I know that can be an intensive lifestyle, so I totally empathize with Victoria and with Alex. Sometimes after the shows they look like they just need someone to do all of the work for them so they can get a good night's sleep. 

By the way, there's a golden pony (horse) in Wishes before the spaceship scene in Forever Still. I don't know why I am sharing this, though when I was a boy, I swear I was abducted from my bed in the middle of the night by a bright flash of light... Though maybe it was just a dream

M2 sieges weren't great, but at least we had whole cities, full stacks of armies attacking you, actual population, cities changing depending on what you built, decent modifiers,  and hell I normally get lots of artillery attacking my cities now without any mods on M2.

[18:03:17] Comment: dywwq18 by cr0sh : Usually all that holds a spring in place is the weight of the vehicle; suspension travel isn't expected to be so great in normal use as to allow the spring to drop out of it's mounts.

Some cars have retaining clips or other extra dodads to help keep a spring in place; other physically limit the suspension travel to help prevent what you see here.

What likely happened here is the car hit a fantastically large pothole, or something happened to allow the suspension to drop much further than normal allowing the spring to pop out of the mounts. Maybe the driver likes to catch air in the vehicle? Or maybe their son, or their daughter's boyfriend (it's almost always the guy)?

It's also possible that a pothole or something like that was hit, and broke a piece of the suspension, which with normal operation allowed the spring to pop out because things were no longer in their proper position.

Also - though it doesn't look the case here - maybe the spring actually broke, giving it enough room to move?

Ultimately - this is something that needs more looking into and a repair done; there's a very real possibility that other damage to other components in the suspension may have occurred, and continued driving on this is only going to result in major heartache down the road. posted to submission: Customer came in for a faulty blinker and I find this.

[18:05:56] Comment: dywwq38 by greentreen : Went on a 3 day backpacking trip in the Rockies, just me and gf. It was raining so we set up camp early and were just hanging out in the tent when nature called. Started walking towards this log a little ways off when some movement caught my eye. There were two moose, about 15 feet away from me, that had been chillin out just perfectly still. Just yanked my pants back up and slowly walked away to do my business somewhere further away. Still ended up taking a dump while staring down a moose. More funny than scary, but for those of you that have never seen a moose they are big. And dangerous. So that kinda scared the shit outta me (lol) in the moment. I've seen plenty of moose but never this close, and never in such a vulnerable moment.  posted to submission: [Serious] Campers of reddit, what is the scariest/creepiest/most disturbing thing that has happened to you in the woods?

The ocean is filled with CaCO3, which is used in shell building. It also acts as an alkaline buffer. So, when CO2 levels increase in the atmosphere, CO2 is absorbed by the oceans. This can then form carbonic acid, which reacts with the CaCO3. Once the levels drop sufficiently, shelled animals can't produce as much shell, so they wind up with thinner, weaker shells. posted to submission: This sea shell

Evolution's backend happens all the time, through tiny random mutations, and the frontend comes in when the environment changes. That's when some tiny mutations come in handy, and the whole species, even though most of it died, survived the threat and keep on doing even better than before.

I guess it's like cockroaches and nuclear weapons.

[18:07:57] Comment: dywwvvg by koetrig : Definitely take advantage of any company matching before focusing on debt. 

After that as the other commenter said I would weigh your interest rates against anticipated returns. If these are open ended investments that you plan to make until retirement, I would probably favor debt if the interest rate was anything over 6-7%. The reason being that we are pretty deep in the current economic rally and various valuation measures are stretched. This isn't a good way to time the market, but it does traditionally suggest that over the next decade expected returns will be lower than average. So if your debt isn't particularly cheap 0%-4% I would pay it off. posted to submission: Getting started question Debt vs Small investment

[18:08:40] Comment: dywx02q by Reddy_McRedcap : Yea this is the one that's the hardest to come to terms with sometimes. When you and your friends get older, partying and just hanging out doesn't happen as often since everyone has their own responsibilities, especially once people start having families. It becomes hard enough to keep steady relationships with just a couple friends, let alone everyone you used to socialize with at parties when you were 20. posted to submission: What are some hard pills to swallow in life?

[18:09:36] Comment: dywx03y by RazziaDK : Just to give you guys a quick follow-up to this issue. As I do not live very close to an IKEA, I wrote to ask them if I could return my Tr√•dfri devices, or get a replacement gateway.

It took them 11 days to answer (They write that they will answer within 5 days..), and I got a somewhat disappointing answer. They recognize that the Homekit integration is not working properly, and that developing an update is highly prioritized.

As there is no problem with the product, and it is used I am not able to return it. To help me they offer to do an exception, so I can return the gateway kit and get my money back. That leaves me with nine bulbs that I cannot use.
I bought a Hue starter kit earlier this week, and have been able to some of the Tr√•dfri bulbs to the Hue bridge, but they do not work in Apples Homekit ‚Äì as expected.

I am trying to decide if I should return the gateway kit, get a new gateway and use both systems or just drop Tr√•dfri completely.

[18:09:48] Comment: dywx04f by Genesis72 : Just did this. Essentially if you apply for Reciprocity, they send you a packet, you fill it out and attach your national card, send it back and they give you a VA license.

For Legal recognition however, they send you a packet, you forward parts of it to your state EMS agency and they fill it out and send it back to VA. You fill out your parts of the packet then attach your state card and send it back. After that they issue you a VA card good for one year and in that time you need to retake the knowledge and practical exam and do 40 hours of con ed.

Long story short I have a couple of bits I am going t send him but if anyone has others I can buy and maybe rustle up a whole PC that would be awesome, I can pay a little bit off money, but I'm sure we've all got parts kicking about that could go to someone who would appreciate them. Who knows, a small act of generosity might change osmoses life for the better, or it might not, he might be a dick, or a scammer, but hell, I'm willing to take that risk...

[18:11:56] Comment: dywx3kr by dirty_diana05 : Well you see now, we're wading into an area where I believe you want me to censor my comments because of personal reasons. And I'm not here for that. 

There are many disgusting, malicious and downright hateful things I've seen on this sub. From causal homophobia, to slut shaming, to name calling, to people constantly making albeist slurs and the like. And I understand that while I may find those comments reprehensible, it's not my place to police anyone's tone. And I don't appreciate anyone trying to police mine. 

Isn't it a tenet of the freefolk sub? To be free to say what you want? 

And also that's the nature of open discourse, we're not always gonna agree or like each other. So it's all cool my end.  posted to submission: Cuties üíúüòÇ

You have a better chance of being struck by lightning multiple times in one lifetime than you do of contracting HIV by playing basketball with someone with the disease.

You need to take some classes or something on probable risk, probabilities, or statistics. Contracting the disease in this way was never a realistic possibility and researchers and doctors of the time knew this fact.

It's a less than a one in a million chance. It's such a minor chance that doctors basically laughed off the players' concerns. If you want to be an idiot and trust yourself over a paid medical professional or researcher, you can be my guest.

For non-interactive apps (basically just video players), auto-hide works. But that's no use for games. You can dim it by enabling edge protection - but that's still no t much use use if your game UI has a navigation bar/menu along the bottom of the screen - the 'uglybar' now obscures it and the whole thing needs moving/redesigning...

[18:14:02] Comment: dywx94m by arsehole-o-matic : >Microsoft PowerPoint against some brain dead ai and blue swirls 

That's the whole point. AI is far more taxing on the CPU (which isn't exactly the strongest part of XB1) compared to 100 players (which if the game was programmed in any way close to proper, would not even be accounted for 90% of the time as they'd be way out of reach to have any influence on your gameplay, see High-Frequency Update Zones of Battlefield games or Level of Detail in general).

In terms of the engine, it's the player entities that are completely brainless, the AI has plenty of thinking to do. posted to submission: Why does PvE run like shit in comparison to BR on Xbox?

[18:14:15] Comment: dywx94o by geetarzrkool : Only you can decide what is best for you. In simplest terms, P-Basses are more common in more styles and have a little bit warmer tone and a slightly wider neck towards the nut, while Jazz basses are a bit punchier/twangier in tone and have a slightly thinner neck near the nut. They're both great basses that will let you play anything you like.

At this point it's much easier to get more merges on Clair than Shigure because Shigure's not so long in the game yet if you're serious about arena optimizing, and outside the arena Clair's Rhompaia is an amazing lance for all other kinds of content. Before her refinement she was mediocre, just like Caeda, but both have statlines that synergize very well with their new weapons and have turned them into strong and dangerous opponents.  posted to submission: Delthea by @khe_mn

This is very much a casual combo, but you cast Myr Battlesphere, get four 1/1 myr tokens, use Saheeli's  -2 ability on the Battlesphere, creating another battlesphere(with haste), producing 4 more 1/1 myr tokens, then attack with the hasted copy, tapping all 8 tokens + the original to burn for 9 direct damage and swing in for 13 damage with the battlesphere.

Driving off into the sunset of magical christmas land, if you have [[fireless fireweaver]] or [[impact tremors]] in play, then you also deal an additional 10 damage in that play.

[18:15:18] Comment: dywxdyn by kygipper : I fully support these specific conversations developing naturally from open public discourse and with help from advocacy groups.  But I do not believe it is helpful to these causes for them to become political footballs.  In fact, as political wedge issues, they will continue to be exploited by both sides, and real progress will hindered as a result.  Demanding that people either support or oppose an issue like transgender rights in the voting booth will only carve deeper and deeper divisions over an issue that the vast majority of Americans have no personal experience with.

The first scenario I dont use much of any throttle at all since the revs just sit in space all day (lol), otherwise my throttle input disturbs the shift. 

If I rev higher and drive more spiritedly ill use a little more throttle.

Also its going to behave differently if you are in normal mode vs sport mode due to the throttle sensitivity. 

Pick one mode and learn it then switch to the other. Its very different than any of my more recent manual transmission cars. posted to submission: 18 Civic Si ‚Äî 5k miles, still can‚Äôt shift smoothly ‚Äî help

>, clearly that is not possible.

No shit, really?

>It's about making sure everyone receives the same opportunities. It is then up to people's freedom of choice to decide what they want to do with those opportunities.

You mean to say that after you just take as read loads of inequalities in opportunity, then you want people to not be interefered with from that point.

Its an incredibly self serving and nonsensical argument.

>Disagreed. Firstly, who decides what the correct reward is given the amount of effort?

No need to find that out, as we are removing already given rewards from the undeserving.

>Secondly, your reward should not only depend on amount of effort.

Yes, it should. 

>If 2 people put in the same amount of effort, 1 breaking rocks and the other creating new medicines, then the second should be given a higher reward, because society wants to incentivize that behaviour.

This makes no sense. You've just said that people start off different due to internal factors - which they didn't create and therefore anything produced by them cannot be claimed on any moral or reward based basis.

[18:18:08] Comment: dywxi2m by NovemberBurnsMaroon : Winning 32 of 38 is not the same as finishing with 100 points though.

100 points will be remembered because it's the record and the first English club to hit that mark in the top flight. 

Before today City already had the points and wins records. Those were previously held by 04/05 Chelsea but the Invincibles season is remembered higher because Chelsea still were unable to go undefeated.  posted to submission: Man City won 32 league games in 2017-18 ‚Äì the most by a side in a single English top-flight season.

I believe that his tweets about needing a ban on all Muslims entering the country were used to argue that his travel ban was unconstitutional because it was intended to target a specific religion. More recently, Michael Avenatti used Trump's tweets saying that he was unaware of any deal/NDA between him and Stormy Daniels to say that the deal was invalid since both parties have to know about a legal agreement.  posted to submission: What do you think of the "Sports Are Political" cartoon?

Superman, while still pretty strong, is notably older and could probably easily be taken out by Batman\(Wouldn't need kryptonite, as even Doomsday was able to damage a Superman in his prime\).

Make sure it's drained very well of its liquid (you can squeze it through a towel or cheesecloth), then press it into a pie pan. For my filling, I used 4 crumbled bacon slices, 4 eggs, 1 cup of almond milk, ~100g shiitake mushrooms, ~140g onions, and half a cup each of skim parmesan and mozzarella. Bake at 400 for 35-45 minutes (depending on your oven) until the filling is firm.

[18:19:17] Comment: dywxllm by canaparachute : When you get into a new tier (e.g., you get to Plat 3 with 2904 point), and then lose enough points to move down (you die early next game and get -35), the game will adjust the lost points so you don't go down a tier (you'll only lose 4 points and go to 2900). But it only does it once: Ff you then lose points again, you'll lose all those points and drop a tier. Even if you gain points after that (e.g., win a game with +12 and go to 2912), and then lose again (get -40), you'll drop down a tier. However, if you drop down a tier and then go back up, you'll get tier protection for your new tier again. posted to submission: Finally - now to go hide in a hut for 5 games.

(b) the destination is within Canada; and

(c) the firearm is posted using the most secure means of transmission by post that is offered by the Canada Post Corporation that includes the requirement to obtain a signature on delivery.

I think that's a postal service requirement.  You can try that defence I guess.

[18:19:49] Comment: dywxlmc by SavioroftheWest : Well its the same with jets and the advanced submarines they built. The jets could have been ready in 1943 and would have had a very significant impact. The new subs could have been ready in 1942 as they didnt actually require any new technology to build them, all the building techniques were there. They just didn't sit down and reexamine them. So they were made in 1944. Not much use then.

Even so. The allies didn't have jets, and the americans took the germans new submarines for themselves because they were the best in the world and better than their own.

Point being, germany could have done better, but they weren't perfect and even still they were very far ahead, further than the allies. Its why the allies copied or based a lot of their new weapons off the germans right after the war. posted to submission: Sure all he did was win the WW2

I got off early after that. Went to the bar just in time for last call (I worked third shift) and proceeded to drink six beers in like 20 minutes. Called my boss, quit, went home and never looked back.

Like for me I have some players added but not because they're friends but because they're simply players... and I really could care less about them as mean as this sounds TT because unlike actual friends I game with.... these ones are like whatever and I personally do not believe in becoming actual friends with someone who is just a random player haha 

So~ if this person is just a random gamer who I guess you got closer with.... I wouldn't bother or care TT 

You're here to play games.... not have to deal with those people who want to turn games into romantic dates or whatever hahaha~ 

And I feel like with harassment and stuff too like.... getting into the mentality that you really don't care about other players and that they're all just like fancier bots can go a long way to making games more enjoyable ‚ô° so like muting everyone and disabling chat and learning to be self efficient in games has always given me the most fun haha

[18:23:16] Comment: dywxqbz by Rikki6190 : I've been trying to understand this behavior but as the last year and a half of HRT  has  gone by, less and less of this has happened to me.  But based on the reactions I do remember getting I am still convinced that it's animalistic human behavior when they do that. It's especially common from less intellectual types. While I would guess that more sophisticated individuals still may identify someone as trans in public they tend to be more understanding by not pointing it out in front of others. 

The ones that misgender or out us maliciously  have some issues going on upstairs with the basis being bigotry at the core.  Or at the very least they have some inferiority complex as the basis for their behaviors. After all what's the point? Why do that to another individual except to be malicious or cruel. Personally I couldn't live with myself to be cruel to someone because they have some physical or appearance that is different. 

 I have concluded on my own that i really don't have anything to worry about these types unless they become belligerent or threatening  to me in public or try and cause me physical harm. In the either  case my  I let my  9 do the talking for me. 

I have my way of handing the occasional stares but like I said it's become an infrequent occurrence.

The dog in the picture is not a Pit Bull either, most likely an AmStaff. And before someone loses their mind telling me it's a blanket term, there is only one breed with the name Pit Bull in it and to keep calling every single bull breed a Pit Bull gives the wrong impression they are all the same breed. This kind of thing is why statistics say Pit Bulls are so high in attacks, because all bull breeds are falsely called Pit Bulls.  posted to submission: üòâ

Take game of thrones for example, it's so wordy and descriptive that I couldn't read it many years before the show was made.

[18:23:55] Comment: dywxqcp by Kylix_ : Yeah, I had a game a yesterday for example that was a clear win for us, but suddenly our DPS McCree got tilted by the other team chatting to him (even though he was doing good) and he switched to Torb and started emoting in our spawn. Without that 6th player helping, we got pushed back into our spawn and ended up losing the match. 

Things like that are why I get so mad. Because the game is so fragile and so delicate that even one player not trying can actually spoil the entire match for 5 other players. Its very frustrating.

How do you deal with it: Well, you tried setting reasonable boundaries, and he doesn't care. I doubt this one issue about your apartment is the only area where he shows entitlement and boundary-ignoring. You can't change him, so ask yourself if you're better off with him or without him. Not "He'd be great if only he'd change X." Accept or reject him as he is. And consider the "costs" of keeping him around - no privacy, not feeling your home is secure, losing roommates (because he will drive them away), always having to be the one to give in, etc. posted to submission: My [20F] boyfriend [19M] kept coming in my house when I'm not there and scaring my roommate.

It doesn't sound free to me. It sounds like if you are not a participant in the network, then you are going to be counted as a leecher and get no priority.

[18:26:14] Comment: dywxwpt by dillrepair : So I was curious on this cause you said glocks and stuff are SAO and cheap crap is DAO but then I remembered my m&p said it was DAO...    so I copied this from mp-pistol forum.  Kind of interesting on the minutiae of it all regarding the smith and Wesson m&p series of pistols: 

Practically, the striker is fully cocked i.e., single action mode.
  Technically, the gun is considered a double action gun because there is a small (like a few thousandths of an inch) rearward movement of the striker as the trigger is pulled all the way.
  Explanation, it all lies in the shape of the sear. S&W has machined a little hump into the top of the sear right where it engages with the striker face. This little hump creates a slight caming effect causing the striker to move rearward very slightly when the sear is engaged enough to allow the striker to fall. However, this rearward movement is not necessary for the gun to fire. So why did S&W build this into the sear design? Two reasons:
  1. If the striker is moved rearward even as slightly as it is in the M&P design, then the gun can be categorized as a DAO gun. Evidently this is necessary for a number of reasons, not the least of which is allowing the M&P to be more readily accepted by law enforcement agencies. 
  2. The hump in the sear allows the sear to move back to its full set position if for whatever reason the trigger is released after not being fully engaged. If the sear moved a little bit, but not enough to break the shot, and then the trigger is released, the sear will cam back to is full set position. This allows the trigger weight to not change from shot to shot regardless of how far the sear moved previously. 
  You can actually see this happen if you look through the back of your gun under the striker cap where the sear and striker engage. Make sure the gun is unloaded, and press the trigger slightly just enough to allow the sear to partially move, and rather than break the shot, release the trigger and you'll see the sear move back to its full seated position ready for a consistent pull the next time the trigger is pressed.
  The exception to number 2 is that an extremely rough striker face can prevent the sear from moving back to it full set position if the trigger is released before the striker is dropped. However, this will correct itself over time as the parts smooth out with use posted to submission: Animated mechanics of a handgun.

It turns out that what they really are is just very different movies, and what's more interesting is Kids is NYC while Don's Plum is LA - sort of an American cultural juxtaposition, both made at the same time, neither influence by the other. Such a shame our film didn't get released in it's time alongside films like "Kids." And even more shameful is that DiCaprio casts this light of shittiness on Don's Plum so our film rarely gets watched with the simple objectivity of new viewer with fresh eyes.

See thats fine. Comforting and helping is fine, but enabling this ridiculous need to save a inanimate object is not reasonable.

> if it's possible (simply going back to the grocery store) just do the silly thing I want? Well of course I would want that. 

Of course you want that, we all want to have our every whim met but giving a alcoholic a drink isn't helping.

Coping with your problems, and having someone who will help you deal with them is good...having someone who will get out of bed and drive you to the liquor store at 3am because you are too hammered to do it isn't. I don't see much difference in enabling her need to save a bumpy fruit...her anxiety is winning and he isn't helping her he is just giving her what she wants.

>Here's the thing- it happens a lot. If you get upset to the point of tears over bumpy fruit, chances are its not a one-time thing either.

He knew thats what it was... that is a pattern of repeated behavior. She does it a lot and he probably continues to solve the problem the same way, continuing the cycle and making her anxiety worse in the long run.

> Often he's there for me, if it's something real, if it's something major, or if it's something silly and he is in a caring mood.

And That's how Syria created by arbitrary lines under french mandate in '20 and Alawite minority rules it...

That's how Iraq was created in '32, Lebanon from arbitrary lines under french mandate in '20...

Israel abides by all LON Mandate directives. it gives FULL Rights to Arabs and other Non-Jews in Israel,

Israel is 20% Arabs, some are even top Commanders, Police officers and law makers, shaping Israeli policy, it's not like they have a problem with Arabs..

Arabs in Israel live as Israelis, with Israeli ID. they have voting rights, they have party and representatives and many of them even serve as soldiers in the Israeli IDF. There is even a **Female Sharia court judge** now in Israel (Which is ridiculous and hilarious in every way imaginable)

http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-appoints-first-female-judge-to-sharia-court/

Muslim arab female diplomat

http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-appoints-its-first-female-muslim-diplomat/

They have more rights in Israel (just like any other israeli) than in Arab countries especially for women or gays.

Israelis are Muslims/Christians/Hindus/Druz/Semeritans/Bah√°'√≠/Kurds from many Ethnicities and races, including Arabs, all of those different Ethnicities were oppressed by the Arabs before Israel, all of them now live in security form oppression in Israel while the barbarians of the Middle east are killing each other.

Looking at the big picture. Other than Jew-Hate. I genuinely don't understand the rejection of the league of nation/UN '48 plan by Arabs and the insanely strong bias today to Israel.

[18:29:25] Comment: dywy3u3 by Valongatz : - Bad CGI

- The move from 24fps to 48 FPS looks like shit

- All the action is badly shot

- The design of all the dwarves is awful. Whenever Balin is on screen I cringe, but pretty much all of the dwarves look terrible 

- All the in between stuff is badly edited, badly written: ie, Gandalfs in between travels, the parts with Radagast, the white council stuff, the adding in of the White Orc arc just to give a film without an antagonist an antagonist 

- pretty much everything about it TBH 


That said, I don't really hate them. I don't think they're the bad guy persay, but it's been known at this point that everyone involved hated working on it. The original Fellowship of actors all got tattoos together, they were a family.

[18:30:00] Comment: dywy3v2 by isolde529 : Hi. Smoked from 18 to 30. It started out as fun and then became, as you said, a way to enhance every moment of my life. Then it became a coping mechanism, a way to endure a job I didn‚Äôt like and friends who didn‚Äôt really care about me. I smoked in the morning, on my lunch break at work, when I got home from work, and after dinner until I passed out. The weekend? Free for all. I smoked all damn day. By the time I was 30 I realized, besides sleeping, I was only sober for a couple hours here and there. And the high wasn‚Äôt the same anymore. It was like I was chasing it and it was taking more and more weed to get me to a place where I wasn‚Äôt feeling anything anymore. At 30, I went to my mom‚Äôs for a long visit. There‚Äôs no smoking at mom‚Äôs so I was sober for about 10 days. When I got back to my apt I immediately lit up and for whatever reason my lungs just couldn‚Äôt handle it. I took it as a sign and stopped then and there. I gave away all my weed and paraphernalia. And most importantly, I got my life in order. I stopped hanging out with my stoner friends and went into hibernation. I had to stay busy. I was anxious and not sleeping. I went thru everything in my house and got rid of everything that reminded me of my old life. I was already seeing a psychiatrist for my bipolar so I talked to him about safely taking medication to help me sleep and keep me from being anxious. I also got my resume together and landed an amazing job where I‚Äôve been more successful than I‚Äôve ever been in my life. I‚Äôm five years sober. It‚Äôs been a long journey. I have an addictive personality and still have to actively work on combatting it. I‚Äôm actually seeing a therapist now to find healthy ways to cope with the grief I feel over my mom passing away a couple years ago. It‚Äôs helping. Hobbies help too. I‚Äôve discovered a passion for reading and that fills the hours at night that I used to spend smoking and vegging out in front of the TV. My dude, you can do this. It might be the hardest thing you‚Äôve ever done, it‚Äôs definitely going to be a long road, but if you take it one day at a time and actively work at it, you can turn your life around.  posted to submission: Finding it hard to relate need older advice

[18:31:48] Comment: dywy8ir by hunteqthemighty : 4th of July, 2014. Hike up to the summit of Mt. Rose. You can see nine fireworks shows standing in one spot, in Tahoe, Reno, Carson, Donner, etc.. 

I made the hike with three buddies. We were wanting to set up the tent a mile off summit and hike down after the fireworks but we decided to setup camp on the summit. Biggest mistake ever. The fireworks ended at 11:00pm and the wind started right after. I fell asleep quickly but we woke up to the tent collapsing on us with the fabric covering our faces. I stayed up wrapping my arms around my face until 6:00am which is when we were planning on waking up and leaving. 

The wind gusts were 60-70 that night.  posted to submission: [Serious] Campers of reddit, what is the scariest/creepiest/most disturbing thing that has happened to you in the woods?

[18:31:54] Comment: dywy8iq by Trollygag : The problem with that argument is that they charge almost 3x more for a civilian sale  as they do to a government. One of the reasons why they won the Army's M4 contract was because they undercut Colt's M4 price of $673 by contracting them for $647/each. That is the same rifle, with additional cuts and parts for auto, that they charge you and me $1800 for - made at the same price from the same factory.  posted to submission: Why exactly are FN SCARs so expensive?

[18:32:18] Comment: dywy8j6 by Borg-Man : A quick thing: Proclaim is cool. Very, very cool. But if you let something only benefit from a Proclaimed card in the same turn as it is Proclaimed, it actually is a Kicker. Breaking Dawn, for example, essentially reads "If ~this was kicked, return all creatures you control to your hand instead of destroying them." I feel that Proclaim should only be used on effects where a Kicker cost wouldn't work. But as said, I really like the concept. Even though the opponent knows that an effect could be cast, they don't know when. I think this is more devious than playing with your hand revealed! posted to submission: [War of Jewels] Full Spoiler 164/164 of Silmarillion Block's 1st Set

No, not exactly.

In fact the added time allowing the water to oxidize and work it's way under the EMI Shields and non underfilled chips can be a death sentence for an otherwise recoverable phone. 

I want nothing more than for people to get their phones wet. That being said, pushing a myth about using food to fix electronics does nothing more than make my job harder and cost people their memories that are in their devices that once we're recoverable.

[18:34:43] Comment: dywyfe4 by AdvancedStatistician : > it generalizes white people in the same way minorities get generalized.

And you think this is a good idea why?

I will give you an example: Myself. First, I am not American - but rather, Dutch. I presume that you ascribe a certain level of "leftness" to North-West Europe by default, and you wouldn't be wrong. 

Now, the past few years have been incredibly confusing to me. I am repeatedly condemned for the color of my skin and my sex - but I'm told that's okay, because I'm in charge or something. Never mind that I grew up poor, and am still poor, and am just barely getting by to the same extent that most lower-middle class people do.

Now, when I was a kid - early '90s - they taught us that racism was bad in school. Or rather, they taught us that discriminating against people was bad. Discriminating against people based on things they didn't have a "choice" in becoming. Nobody chooses their skin color, or their eye color. They don't choose their sex. They don't choose their length, or their name. 

The reason we were taught *discrimination* is wrong (and not racism, necessarily), is because discrimination is the thought process that is the framework for things like racism and sexism. We grew up to believe that everyone was equal, and should be treated as such.

Now, as you get older you start noticing more 'inconvenient' things: Hey, wait a second, X or Y minority is involved in way more crime/violence, etc. What is going on? (For us, this is Morrocans. For you, pick which you like) The proper explanation is that many of these people come from worse socio-economic backgrounds, which influences criminal behavior and the like. Worse, those circles are self-reinforcing: If your peers turn to criminal behavior, they'll pressure you to join, etc.

So, we know that minorities have worse X or Y stats, but we remember that we shouldn't discriminate. In other words: Even if X or Y is more likely to be a criminal, or perform worse in schools, that isn't true for all of them. And until we *know*, we shouldn't make any judgement, because they're individuals - just like everyone else - and their experiences don't necessarily line up with what statistics say.

The point I'm getting to is simply: If the basis for racism is discrimination, you trying to combat that by discriminating against people is doing nothing more than saying that racism *is* okay. And every time you shout "white people x" or "all men y", you are enforcing the notion that treating people like individuals *isn't* required, but that you're allowed to to target white people / men for some reason.

Treat everyone like individuals, or no one. If you do it selectively, however, you will only guarantee that anyone impressionable who watches your behavior will walk away learning the wrong thing entirely: Discrimation is the right thing to do - as long as the target is right.

[18:35:14] Comment: dywyfej by PNelliJelly : Okay so I'm a lurker on here, but I have been giving this issue a lot of thought and want to toss in my two cents. 

I am by no means condoning Ameer's abusive actions toward these women. What he did is disgusting and it needs to be exposed. These accusations potentially prove that Ameer was and may still be a disrespectful asshole. 

But I also feel that Ameer and Brockhampton now have an opportunity that must be recognized.  Why I love this group so much is that they are all about flipping peoples ideologies, and providing a podium for those who may have trouble speaking out and having respect within society.  This is evidenced with things like their intention of interrupting the definition of a "boyband" and their support of the LGBTQ community.  Because of this, Ameer and rest of BH (if it's true that some members knew about the abuse and kept quiet) owe it to the fans and especially the abused women to make things better.  I'm not saying Ameer's actions deserve forgiveness, but if he & the group really care for what BH seems to stand for, and if Ameer really has grown since then and realized how wrong his actions were, he should use his platform to talk about it with the intention to bring about ideological and social change. As I said before, BH wants to be a presence to spark conversation about issues within our society.  And if they & Ameer truly want to bring change and not just monetarily profit off of social justice conversation then these allegations, what it means to be a man in todays world, what it means to respect others, what it means to realize toxic and hurtful actions, and what it means to grow MUST be addressed in their content. 

Being said, I don't think just kicking Ameer out of BH is the best option.  If BH truly embodies what it seems to market itself as, it should be used as an inclusive voice for those who need to see what abuse is and why it is not okay.  I think if BH and particularly Ameer can step up to the plate and prove to us that he doesn't want a world filled with people like the old (and hopefully not the present) him, then important conversations can emerge and positive change will follow.  If Ameer doesn't truly believe in fixing these issues that plague people (and particularly women) in our society, then he has no place in the BH I hope truly exists. 

That's my take.  posted to submission: Ameer Drama Megathread

[18:35:19] Comment: dywyfek by yoshi570 : You made these words yours. If you are quoting them, they are now yours to defend. This is a rather simple concept: just because you quote arguments does not mean that they are immune to criticism. If you do not feel up to the task of defending them, fine. Really, that's fine. But admit it and say that you are not really good with arguments and that while you see the arguments laid out in front of you, you do not feel that you are armed to contradict them.

>The argument isn't that complicated, bud. You're just plugging your ears to it and posting iamverysmart material in the process.

This is literally what you've been doing all along. Talk about projection 101, *bud*.

>All this separates the racial aspect of being proud that you're black. It wouldn't excuse nonsense about superiority, but that's hardly what it's all about if you've been paying attention whatsoever.

This is literally the only argument you've laid so far: it's weak. I could also tell you that white pride is also not about race or superiority. There you go: you can look up all the fight against that idea and the attempts at dissociating white pride and race/superiority and you will find what destroys this attempt of yours. It works both ways.

Of course that "black pride" will not be about race/superiority for every black people. And that's just as true for "white pride" people. But there will be people in both movement that will make it about race/superiority. I have been paying attention, and I have witnessed racism against white people, discrimination, insults and just pure hate. It exists. Is it more common all in all in the "white pride" movement? I do think so, yes. But that's no argument to claim one is ok and the other isn't: both are not ok. There's not a percentage of people making it about race where you suddenly decide "oh yeah, now it's bad!".

Identity is not about skin colour. There are people that are not white and absoluely successful in the USA (because we really are talking about the USA only, something I tried to warn you not to do, but that you dismissed like the rest). Asian people? Successful. Not whites. How come? Well it may be that ... they did not arrive in America being slaves. 

Again, funding an identity around origins as slaves is fine and logical. Making it about skin colour isn't. posted to submission: Social Justice Warrior takedown

My wife is also teacher, and teaches grade school in a primarily low income immigrant area.  Everybody wants to act like teachers are the sole cause and area for improvement to much more complex problems.  You've got kids coming from horrible home situations, few English skills, who have been socially promoted into your classroom despite not learning the previous years material.  The teachers don't want to do this promotion and actively argue against it, but admin calls the shots and holding students back pisses off parents and makes the school look like it's failing, so up they move.  Usually one or 2 kids in any given class are such disruptive nightmares that all the teacher's time is spent simply trying to keep order and they don't even get a chance to help the well behaved ones learn.  But OMG so much as touch the nightmare child and lose your job in a heartbeat, despite the nightmare child is hitting others and/or screaming and won't stop.  Often little support from admin in these situations.  Many completely absent parents who show up for nothing, or just show up to bitch at the teacher because they can't make up in 1 year for their child's lifetime of poor parenting.  And then as you say, a rigid curriculum that changes with the whims of politicians that have never set foot in a class room.  The teacher ends up feeling like a demoralized cog spouting someone else's lesson plans.

Wrong. Dead wrong. They aren't "realizing" anything because the definition of realize is "becoming fully aware of something as a fact; understand clearly".

[18:38:00] Comment: dywym6w by Cornak : Frat has given up on their war against TEST, in which they planned to not rest until TEST was evicted from Esoteria. TEST, obviously, has not been evicted. They have now refocused their war effort to beating the dead horse that is the DRF to their northeast, away from TEST. They may attempt a few face saving ratter ‚Äòharassments‚Äô in Eso, but it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll succeed in anything, given that all our ratters in anything of substance should be deployed right now, meaning the only things ratting or mining in Eso are godforsaken krabs and VNI alts. They may even point to Eso having a reduced output in the MER next month as some kind of glorious victory, while ignoring the fact that we‚Äôll have been deployed for most of the month. posted to submission: Winter Co.

[18:38:01] Comment: dywym6x by Halfrican253 : I‚Äôve had a similar issue until I found out that when my Ride app had made the first initial connection via Bluetooth then the Boosted Board will not connect. The fix was;

1. to close out both apps
2. Connect to the board first with Boosted‚Äôs app
3. If you want to use the Ride app open that up next and it will connect automatically. At this point you can use both apps. 

Hope that helps! #boostlife posted to submission: Anyone else have this problem with the app not pairing ?

[18:38:46] Comment: dywym82 by flercemel0n : 2 things here.

First, I have a problem with probability being used as a determination of "safe".

A place with 4 murders is far safer than a place with 1000 murders, even if because the number of people in the second place, it's less likely to be me being one of the 1000 people murdered. There are still 996 more murders in the second place. 

Both probability and frequency are needed to determine how safe a person is, not just individual probability.

Second, it's important to note I mean violent crime as a whole, not just murder.

I don't have a cite off hand, I'll try to find it again. Just been in the "guns are bad, mmmkay" argument for a long time. I found that pretty interesting at the time I read it.

One thing I did learn in my studies on this subject:

[18:39:56] Comment: dywyqzk by Tobi-of-the-Akatsuki : Musselforge Fitness and Humpback Pump Track are both garbage maps, to the point where I just don't play if they're in rotation. Sadly, this mentality often means that I don't play for the whole day after work because it's usually one map right after the other.

Now that Blackbelly is back, Humpback feels absolutely pointless in theme, and has such inconsistent terrain. Musselforge is pretty much the same shit. Also, they're tied for the ugliest-looking maps in the game without question.

Hawai'i is getting more and more developed, but this coast has sacred sites and this keeps the whole section of the island wonderfully pristine and isolated. 

My favorite thing on the whole island is the Kalalau trail, the hike along the Na pali coast. All the work makes the views even better. Taking a boat to snorkel that side of the island is my second favorite (local guides best guides). Never done the helicopter tour, glad it was a blast!  posted to submission: Took a helicopter ride around Kauai. 10/10 worth it. The Napoli Coast is the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

[18:40:22] Comment: dywyr03 by ExpensiveReception : Her behaviour towards Clay was extremely belittling, and as someone who "filled out" after high school I can't help but sympathize with the guy. It's really difficult growing up and seeing your peers party, have sex, and mature while you're stuck on the sidelines. I related like crazy when she was ripping on Clay (in a friendly way, sure, but still mockingly) while checking out Justin near the start of the series. 

A lot of people suggested that she was negging him as it's called nowadays and that he should have picked up her hints but how is that any different than the way a lot of the guys treated her? Clay didn't deserve that shit. And then, when he finally gets up the courage to make a move, she behaves like he was raping her (again, understandable after what she's gone through). That guy is going to have trust issues for life. posted to submission: Anybody else feel bad but not like Hannah?

Anyway a few minutes in he reached into his jeans pocket and pulled out a hand full of loose slices of cooked ham and was offering it to us all. Looked genuinely surprised that nobody was accepting his offer. He then shortly after told me that his girlfriend had recently dumped him because he sat on her face without asking. Craziest starting conversation I'd ever had with anyone, we still see him a lot when we go there, turned out to be a really lovely guy, just a little odd.

[18:42:49] Comment: dywyw2r by BluAnimal : There may be but there is no point writing laws to stack on top of our current laws when those aren‚Äôt being enforced properly. The vast majority of mass shootings were 100% preventable had laws been enforced properly; Sutherland Springs shooter should have been ineligible for a purchase after he was dishonorable discharged and had a history of domestic violence. Cruz should have been ineligible to purchase firearms after numerous police visits and reports of domestic abuse/elder abuse.

I also accept that everything in life has some marginal risk. When I drive my car on the interstate I understand that Becky two lanes over from me may believe texting is more important than navigating two tons of steel at 80mph. But I still take that risk and accept that it can happen.

[18:42:52] Comment: dywyw2u by Epssus : Wow that‚Äôs complerely bizzarre - I suppose it could be related to better quality (Grade C or D) or different category of components installed (Industrial vs Military for example) - the Starfarer Gemini being faster than the base Starfarer strongly suggests something like that.

I also wonder if they plan to have mass (aka cargo loading) affect quantum acceleration and speeds and that‚Äôs not yet implemented. Like, a fully loaded cargo ship will not travel as fast in quantum as an empty one.

I hope that it‚Äôs component based, and not a systematic thing tha big ships just go faster.  posted to submission: A specetruckers dilemma. Fighter vs Turret

The idea of attractivity is subjective

Meaning it cant be measured on a mathematical scale and fully opinion based.

So some people will see themselves as more attractive or unattractive as they are and some people just wont care.

Your attractivity is more tied in with your confidence.

And do we perceive the world or ourselves as other perceive us? Now thats a question Philosophers and Psychologists have been trying to answer for a very long time. posted to submission: Do our brains really fool us into thinking we're more attractive when seeing ourselves in the mirror?

[18:43:23] Comment: dywyw3e by StaplerLivesMatter : Interesting. So, if you remove the bolt and carrier and then put a round in the chamber, it noticeably binds up? It won't spin freely and fall out under gravity? 

After inspecting all the mating surfaces, the last thing you might want to try is a chamber brush, acetone/mineral spirits/etc, and a cordless drill. There could still be some lacquer from shooting steel case ammo built up in the chamber and causing it to stick. That might account for sticking with unfired ammo, as other chamber issues will only manifest when the casing fire-forms to the chamber. 

Chuck the brush up in your drill, maybe on the end of a flexible nylon rod, soak it in solvent, and go to town on that chamber. Don't forget to run a bit of oil or CLP or something down the barrel afterwards, as the solvent will strip out all the oil. 

After that it may be worth a visit to a gunsmith to gauge the chamber and look for other issues.  posted to submission: NEED HELP ASAP Why does my SKS do this?

[18:43:47] Comment: dywyw3r by ajwells007 : Black magick is any type of magick which intends to alter the will of another without their permission, OR magick which intends to cause physical or non-physical harm to another person and is done either consciously or unconsciously. On the day to day end of things, passive aggressive behavior can be considered black magick. On the radical spectrum of things, slipping any amounted dose of menstrual blood into a victims beverage will act as a love spell. Black magick isn't "bad" it's just that so many people get into it without considering that there WILL be payment. It's how the dark side works (as well as the light), but it just works differently. So if the intention behind the spell is lack, desire, passion, etc the seeker should be prepared to pay for that. With white magick, the seeker sacrifices their attachment to ego in exchange for communion with their holy guardian angel. In black magick, the seeker typically must sacrifice something they want for another thing they want. Using your specific love scenario, an unintended consequence could be that the spell works SO well and now the victim is clingy, or the victim generates a depression unless they can be with you. Now, not only are you harming yourself but harming the victim as well because they don't understand why they feel the way they do. These are just examples of how black magick could backfire to some degree, but there are always the less extreme cases where the sacrifice made is somewhat of a financial investment in that person, or that person requiring a lot of your attention, or a co-dependent development in the works. 

For me, I skip the line and just work with white magick for the time being. There may come a time when black magick will be very helpful to me and those around me, but for now I lack the discernment to know when it's appropriate to use. Best to just practice honing my character and refining my communication with higher beings so that I can make peace with the underworld.

Typically in these scenarios, a divination tool can be helpful. Pendulums, tarot, scrying.. phrasing the question to say something like, "what will be the outcome if I go down this intended path" and then letting the divination explain what COULD happen if you continue down that directed path. All things are subject to change, especially when the level of intention adjusts. So, then, even if a physical action is repeated in exactly the same way every time, the intention behind it completely changes the action in the first place.. I know I'm getting a bit abstract by now but I hope I'm making a bit of sense! (: if you have any more questions I'm here for you

[18:45:38] Comment: dywz1mq by ghostchamber : Well, you can either accept the black-and-white "it's a music channel or not" without any nuance, *or* you can accept that it has always been a sliding scale and some people have different tolerances for it. I'm not saying they *weren't* playing music videos in 2006 or 1999, I'm saying they weren't playing *many* of them as way back as the early/mid-90s. 

That said, if you consider that the [M2 channel launched in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV2)--and that the *reason* it launched is because MTV had strayed so far from actually being a music channel--you can see that the data supports my argument more than it does yours. posted to submission: M.

[18:46:17] Comment: dywz1nj by _demetri_ : 
Hux often found himself with a migraine these days... And no... Don‚Äôt cue the smallest violin in the world, and it wasn‚Äôt from his brain freezes from eating too much ice cream. This was different.

Even now, in the darkness of a shadowed bunker, turned in toward the wall beside his cot, his skull was throbbing, pulsing with an unending wave of electricity. The ebb and flow of static between the synapses of his hollowed-out skull were tethered like a string to his every thought, so fantastical it succeeded in stealing Hux‚Äôs breath even now. An omnipresent sensation, fire crawling underneath his skin. It erupted like a spark drawn along the frayed wire which made up the once-General‚Äôs nervous system-- and the sensation had never failed to relax his uneasy body, always tense and worn-down under the catastrophic weight of apparent failure.

It had been, Hux considered, approximately five months since the decimation of everything he‚Äôd once held dear-- the cataclysm of an event in which his sole purpose for living had crumbled along with Starkiller Base. Even those momentary flashes of glowing orange light on the back of his eyelids could never dismiss the overall loathing Hux had come to understand so intimately; after all, he was weak.

Weak, just as his father had said. That was fact, the common knowledge borne from human intuition, and all Armitage had to do to understand it was catch a glimpse of himself in the mirror.

Bloodshot eyes, swollen and brightly-scarlet, the sclera a mess of pinched nerves from his constant rubbing. His cheeks, too, were flecked with circles of black, bruised at the edges-- the contrast to the rest of his face, a ghostly white, dyed like some sort of force-phantasm, seemed enough of a testament to his illness. Sickly, and weak; good for absolutely nothing, wasn‚Äôt he? Revolting, useless whelp, inadequate, clumsy.

Armitage drew a palm across the hallow of his throat, ringed with green-and-yellow bruises over a week old; they still felt uncomfortable, though not quite sore to the touch.

He dug his fingers in, pinching the flesh taut between sharpened nails, trying to hold himself steady for as long as he possibly could. The authoritarian voice in his head counted for him, second after second--

onetwothreefour

fifteensixteenseventeeneighteen

Hux gasped, jerked himself away from the reflection of disappointment, clutching tight to his own downtrodden figure with limbs pulled close. Something sounds from in the distance; outside of the window, footsteps and a thud against his own wall;

back

For a man whose career relied on his intellect, oration and organizational skill, Armitage Hux had grown exceptionally skilled at falling apart. The throbbing within his skull began to beat in time with his heart, with each thud and glare and menace as the presence drew closer, tugging him out from the confines of order as he quickly shed the few clothes remaining on his body; black underwear that clung to the subtle curve of his hips, doing little in the way of covering his lower body and a faded, grey shirt, long sleeved and now too big, hanging over his ribs like a curtain.

         backtheycamebackforyou

                         dearhostdear

                                                    ... mate.

‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù Hux beckons to the darkness. His tone would be unfamiliar to any who once knew him, and yet it feels proper, ringing with the emptiness and fragility that sings within his bloodstream. ‚ÄúMy Alien.‚Äù

And the creature does, then, with all the grace a wretched monster could possibly muster. It emerges from the shadows like a wraith, deadly-sleek and outfitted with fine blades along its spine, stretching from its vertebrae down to the curve of its flicking tail. Its head, an elongated cranium bracketed in by the cool, obsidian armor of its carapace, seems to dip in response to Hux, and he croons-- so beautiful, magnificent, a weapon of unrivaled authority that longs for his presence! Fantastical, divine, luminous-- his weapon, his lover, mine mine MINE.

But then, the Xenomorph is not sentient. Not as he is, at the very least, and Hux finds himself having to question his own motives‚Ä¶ whether it is merely his own riveting desire for companionship that makes him believe such a beast is capable of emotion. As though the Alien could feel sentiment, let alone for him, a worthless, irreverent Host.

Still, it does not deter him from stepping closer, excitement bubbling out from the decaying mass of his unbeating heart. Hux believes he could fall into a frenzy, with the way his body arches and slackens and complies to the Xenomorph‚Äôs whims as the creature curls one giant arm around his back, digs into the curve of his bony waist with pointed claws.

Hux gasps .

His own body is opening up to the Xenomorph‚Äôs presence, reminding him of where he belongs-- never with the Order, never, not in the dying vestiges of an unworthy empire, but here, with the only being in the galaxy that is capable of taming him. Xenomorph XX121, they called it, predatory lifeform, eusocial, parasitic--

Mine, Hux decides, echoing his thoughts aloud as he leans forward to settle his head against the curve of the creature‚Äôs outer mouth. The Xenomorph does not make a move to devour him, and he knows better than to think so low of it; this Alien is a true gift, a real mesmer amongst the grey-and-black tombstones of the Unknown Regions.

whydoesitproject

whydoesmatelingerhere, notourredemperor?

broodisgonenow?

Hux nods, a simple motion, singular and respectful, curling into the hard shell of the Alien‚Äôs body. He should feel hatred, should be afraid, and yet he never is; he accepts this existence, accepts his failure, and yet he likely wouldn‚Äôt have without the Xenomorph‚Äôs discovery. The Alien is a true Diviner, it has saved him from his own ignorance and lacking capacity, his own sycophantic nature.

A spark reignites, and electricity floods Armitage‚Äôs head once more.

warmheresafehereoursours ours

beautifulHOSTreceptivetoimpulsesclingstospinelikeneonate

He laughs, then, bitter and careless. ‚ÄúYes, I suppose I am, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù

HOSTstilldoesnotfear??

‚ÄúNo. Never.‚Äù Hux mumbles, surging up to grasp the thing about its back, avoiding the razor-sharp protrusions in its armor. ‚ÄúYou should never fear power‚Ä¶‚Äù

(Should never fear death.)

As if on cue, Hux can feel the tremble along the back of his legs, the slackening in each knee, his limbs halfway to collapsing on themselves, bending and shifting into whatever submission his Alien needs. Slick lines his thighs, a viscous, oozing slime that coats the back of his legs and the line of his rim, desperate and ready for the Xenomorph to partake in coupling with him once more, should the creature desire it. He falls back against the floor, the wicked tail between his bare thighs, urging them apart, urging his back to arch and his skin to crawl once more, an uncomfortable tingling within his naked chest.

                                                                                                        giveYOURSELFtoME A r m i t a g e

 

He feels something sharp prodding at the corner of his mouth, the same moment as that lovely, questing ovipositor positions itself between his legs, heavy against the underside of his filling cock.

needthispower powerbindsmebinds  ... us

                                     mateHAVEME

And with the Xenomorph‚Äôs head at his shoulder, the Xenomorph‚Äôs regal, demanding figure surrounding Hux as he arches and splits and bows against the cold metal of the floor, it takes him, seizes him, reshapes him into something indefinitely seraphic . The omnipresent voices that press through each of his thoughts settle, rumbling with their mirth and their joy in each of Hux‚Äôs jilted movements, his own desperation.

Without the Xenomorph, he feels deprived of something central to his being; his core hollowed-out, a void of endless chaos. In the here and now, he is allowed to rest, to submit and turn himself over to the primitive emotions that he once found trivial.

Hux would do anything, give anything, for this monster of his. He would blight the galaxy once more with his inner pestilence, throw himself into ruin amongst whatever shards remained-- and none of it would cause him distress.

For Armitage Hux has always been selfish, a man whose spirit brimmed with both hubris and insecurity alike. He loathes for the sake of loathing, destroys for the sake of his own reputation. But he does not love, he does not long, and he has never understood those who do. Yet to have the Xenomorph indulge his most shameful fantasies makes him feel benevolent.

[18:46:44] Comment: dywz1o1 by Azudra : I didn't tried the spyro ones because it doesn't seem to be comparable to the main games. Spyro is an open world 3d game. It's gameplay can't be good if adapted to GBA ressources. This is not the case for Crash since it's not open world and even has 2d levels in the originals, giving it a close feel to the main trilogy. I personally had no problems to adapt to these games because it felt exactly the same just without 3d levels.

Some levels in the GBA levels include flying in the sky or place or surfing on the ocean, I didn't liked them, but all other levels with the basic jump n' run gameplay feel great. posted to submission: Worthy/canon games?

[18:46:54] Comment: dywz1o2 by MrKenny_Logins : Okkk ok yeah, agreed, but he was also screwed over trying to find an appropriate response to the deadliest terror attack in modern history, and he was only 8 months in office.  Everyone in the U.S. was seeing red and wanted blood.  I'm genuinely curious to how his presidency would've shaped up had 9/11 not happened.  Not like I think he would've done anything monumental, he just wouldn't have stood out so much as a "bad" president.  Regardless I still think he was a little blip on the radar compared to the damage Trump will potentially end up doing.  Maybe we're just desensitized after Bush and Obama, but at least they both held up some semblance of leadership and direction whether it was a left or right agenda.  I was still just a teenager for most of Bush, but I never felt this pure embarrassment to be an American that Trump has forced on us. posted to submission: Donald Trump may be the best thing that ever happened to George W.

[18:47:03] Comment: dywz1od by phosphenes : Also, it's worth mentioning the there were reports of living elephant-like creatures in the American West. From Thomas Jefferson's book Notes on the State of Virginia:

>A Mr. Stanley, taken prisoner by the Indians near the mouth of the Tanissee, relates that, after being transferred through several tribes, from one to another, he was at length carried over the mountains West of the Missouri to a river which runs westwardly; that these bones abounded there; and that the natives described to him the animal to which they belonged as still existing in the Northern parts of their country; from which description he judged it to be an elephant.

It's hard to say if these rumors came from wishful thinking on the part of the colonists, stories created to explain actual fossil finds, or -my favorite- an oral history passed down from before their extinction. posted to submission: TIL Thomas Jefferson was skeptical about extinction, and thought mastodons were probably lurking in the deep West.

and then Peterson fights back with good science:

[18:48:54] Comment: dywz6j3 by Bertiederps : Ruax pressed his temples as the double shift dragged on. Nine more hours, then he could spend the remaining time off for standard Damnation, being immolated and cleansed. He looked forward to it.

He listened to the prayers of a eight year old, asking that he made mom proud with his spelling bee tomorrow. Ruax flipped through the child's vocabulary, saw he struggled with the "i before e" concept, and ensured the words 'niece', 'neighbour' and 'seizure' made it into the list. He closed involvement and passed it to the Fates to decide who got which words. Maybe the kid would get lucky. 

He listened to three people in a row say "oh God why do I keep doing this", and stamped two of them with [RHETORICAL] and pushed them aside. The third seemed like she'd benefit from learning a lesson about moderation, so he extended her alcohol poisoning by 48 hours. Maybe she'd go easy next payday.

He listened to some man moaning about how he needed inspiration to finish a project due the next day, and considered how best to resolve it. Mastema, sat in the adjacent cubicle, was making a mocking beak shape with her hand. The team leader, Semyaza, flashed a hostile glare their direction and they abated. Ruax injected the project worker with a shot of adrenaline, but not until eleven p.m. 

He looked at the monthly internal email about targets, and how the Chief Executive would be expecting an improvement this quarter. Ruax sighed and wished for some ice water.

The familiar sound of an old lady he knew. Modern Greek. She tended to pray each night to reflect on her day. Her file said it helped her sleep. She worried about her sons. Neither prayed. Both were fairly successful, but on a very different waiting list. Go figure.

Ruax let the woman's prayer run its course, and watched the clock tick forward relentlessly.

Below the clock, a sticker read THE BEATINGS SHALL CONTINUE UNTIL MORALE IMPROVES. 

He still hadn't decided whether it was a joke or a bulletin.  posted to submission: [WP] Due to the sheer amount of prayers God has started call centers. You are one of the damned forced to answer frivolous prayers for all eternity.

We were at a big table in the middle of the dining area so everyone there witnessed this. To top it all off, our server was a woman I went to high school with years ago.

[18:49:03] Comment: dywz6j9 by StrayYoshi : Not being able to have fun without _____ is always a bad sign. The way I see it is if you play alone and it results in problems elsewhere for you, something is wrong. I think group play is different because you might actually have friends that want you to play or help them. If that's the case retiring from a game is the best option. I had to let go of league of legends because I just didn't have the time for it. I'd say the bigger problem here is not having any other alternatives to having fun. If you're the type that doesn't find anything else fun, even looking for a hobby is a hobby on it's own. posted to submission: Does anyone have a problem maintaining their daily chores, daily duties, or any kind of obligations while playing poe?

[18:49:13] Comment: dywzac4 by alltheseflavours : No, it shouldn't, there's no good reason for a loss streak at all. Win streaks serve a function however.

Win streaks are one way to accelerate the progress of smurf accounts back to their true rank. If a WS did artifically boost you too high, it wouldn't be a giant overshoot.

Losses with no loss streak would then dial your character in, punctuated by individual wins.

Loss streaks and win streaks combined make your rank fluctuate too wildly. You'll blow past your rank, then blow back down below it, and repeat.

No streak system at all allows easier smurfing, as does no win streak but a loss streak. posted to submission: Glory loss streak needs to go.

[18:49:23] Comment: dywzaci by JustWastingTimeAgain : In many categories, there is zero domestic manufacturing capacity, and certain countries have become THE place to source.  For example, Vietnam for technical shells.  Also, a couple other things.  Cost, obviously.  Even if there were domestic capacity, a $400 jacket would need to cost upwards of $1000 if made domestically and of course any company who would go it alone in this realm would sell zero units vs their competitors.  As far as shipping on the water goes, it's greener than you think because those tankers hold so much.

[18:50:44] Comment: dywzae4 by JTW24 : Although everything you're asking has been answered in countless iterations, and can easily be found online, I'll humor you. 

\> Terrible, long name. Why the fuck Basic Attention Token?

BAT is about as close to brevity as you can get. The long version name describes exactly what the utility token is. I don't see any issue personally, but if you have a better suggestion, I'd be happy to hear it. 

\> What motive would a user have to switch from a normal browser to the BAT  browser? Wheres the edge? 

I believe you mean the \[Brave\]\([https://www.brave.com](https://www.brave.com)\) browser, not the BAT browser. Brave allows you to connect with the web like any other browser, but it has additional benefits, such as integrated privacy and fingerprint protection, forced https, TOR tabs, integrated blockchain browser, faster load times, and a lot more. Some other browsers offer similar tools, but only with third party extensions. 

As far as "switching browsers," every internet user has been switching browsers since the first browser was ever developed. The notion that no one will ever switch browsers again is bizarre and ignorant to history.

It's a moot point in any event though, because BAT is not limited to Brave browser alone.

\> Those who don't like ads can block them anyway.

Actually, \[studies show\]\([https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair\-2017\-Adblock\-Report.pdf](https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf)\) that only 11&#37; of the global internet population are blocking ads, although that number is growing. Digital ads are profitable, and in 2017, earned over \[$200 billion\]\([https://www.recode.net/2017/12/4/16733460/2017\-digital\-ad\-spend\-advertising\-beat\-tv](https://www.recode.net/2017/12/4/16733460/2017-digital-ad-spend-advertising-beat-tv)\) world wide, with this number projected to grow. 

Here are some really interesting metrics, \> Exhibit A: **74\%** of American adblock users say they leave sites with adblock walls

\> Exhibit B: **77\%** of American adblock users willing to view some ad formats

This is a clear indication that the current system is broken, and a huge opportunity to capture a lot of money is here. This is the idea behind Brave/BAT, to create a better, mutually beneficial system. They don't want to just pay you in BAT for viewing shitty ads, they want to reduce the volume, increase the quality, and deliver them in an effective way. Because ad block is growing, publishers need an ecosystem where users are willing to view ads, but they need to be incentivized, thus Brave/BAT. In addition, with blockchain, KYC, and a few nifty tricks Brendan has, they can dramatically reduce bot fraud, which will decrease wasted revenues. 

\> Why would I watch ads for BAT tokens?

Statistically, the majority of users watch ads \(see my sources above for confirmation\). This means users can switch to a more privacy focused browser, access content faster, see less ads, browse all the same sites, and earn income in exchange for their attention. User data is the most \[valuable resource\]\([https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656\-data\-economy\-demands\-new\-approach\-antitrust\-rules\-worlds\-most\-valuable\-resource](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource)\) right now, and more people need to understand that their attention is worth something. 

\> Usually the projects that use lots of marketing are the worst in value.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Brave isn't heavily marketed at the moment. 

\> But also for the advertiser the value in forced ads is very low. I mean even now the value of running YT ads is terribly small.

The \[studies\]\([https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations\-and\-Whitepapers/2016/The\-Value\-of\-a\-Digital\-Ad](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/The-Value-of-a-Digital-Ad) I have reviewed disagree.  Still, let's assume you are correct. This makes the case for Brave even stronger, as they are deliberately trying to make the digital ad experience better. 

\> I mean even now the value of running YT ads is terribly small. Famous  YTers get so much more by direct product placements in their videos.

Do you mean the value to content creators? I don't know the exact figures in 2018, but the CPM model used to \[be around $7\]\([https://www.tubefilter.com/2014/02/03/youtube\-average\-cpm\-advertising\-rate/](https://www.tubefilter.com/2014/02/03/youtube-average-cpm-advertising-rate/)\), which is pretty good, and that revenue source is coming from a single sector, with a lot of layers of middle\-men taking a cut. With BAT, all of that is eliminated, and CC are paid directly for the user attention they obtain. This means anyone, anywhere on the planet can become an instant financial contributor. 

\> IMO the future of advertising will be influencers, clever product  placements in movies etc. but not those forced, annoying stuff that you  watch for money or free content on YT.

I agree, and so does Brave. They are not trying to monetize the current model. They are creating a better model, with obvious incentives. If you think digital advertising is going away, and everyone will be using ad blockers, you're crazy. 

\> A good comminity stands out in the way they react to critics. I'm excited to find out about you.

I think all of your questions are great! Brave/BAT doesn't have the magic formula finished \(yet\), but they have the right model, the right technology, and the right team.  posted to submission: FUD from an outsider

[18:51:08] Comment: dywzaef by Hairpin88 : Last year I moved from a vegan-friendly city to the sticks, so I've been experimenting with alternatives to vegan prepackaged protein. I've been playing around with lots of seitan recipes and ended up combining the best ingredients from several. A friend, who is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy minus the potatoes, said it was "all right", which is huge. Also, the cost is less than half compared to frozen chicken. 

If you're having problems finding vital wheat gluten, it can be found here on Amazon for really cheap: 
https://www.amazon.com/Vital-Gluten-Anthonys-Pounds-Protein/dp/B00PB8U7Y0/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1526228474&sr=1-4&keywords=vital+wheat+gluten&dpID=41mzSF8WRxL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch








__Okay, so here is the recipe:__

Preheat Oven to 400 F

In a large mixing bowl. (If you have a stand mixer with a dough attachment, use it, it'll save you lots of work!)

1 Cup Vital Wheat Gluten


2/3 Cup Vegan Veggie Broth (Better than Bouillon works great)


1/2 Tbsp Smoked Paprika


1 Tbsp Vegan Teriyaki Sauce (I used Wegman's brand)


1 Tbsp Vegan Kansis Style BBQ Sauce (Wegman's brand)


1/2 tsp Black Pepper


2 Cloves Pressed Garlic




Knead for three minutes, rest for 5, then knead for 10. Form into 1 inch thick logs, cover the logs in more BBQ Sauce. Wrap the logs tightly in tinfoil. Place on a baking sheet into the heated oven for one hour. Flip logs occasionally to make a nice crispy crust.

You need to provide evidence to substantiate such theories by providing more examples of similar occasions where this is the case.

[18:55:24] Comment: dywzjy7 by politicalanimalz : Representative Democracy...when working right.  The goal is for the smarter amongst us to represent ALL of us, which means the better approaches win out over mob mentality, ignorance, and fearmongering.

How do we fix our representative democracy?

Public.  Campaign.  Financing.

There will always be corrupt politicians, usually around ~10% if I remember the statistics.  But we have ethics panels and laws and reporters etc. to deal with them, as we used to.

But today ALL politicians are compromised by the 1% and megacorporations right out of the gate because they need to buy very expensive TV ads for months even years on end to run for office.  

By shortening the election window to 6-8 weeks or so and funding publicly (all sorts of proven ways already work all over the world) we allow our elected leaders to lead and no longer require them to be first and foremost responsible to monied interests.

Certainly.

> I don't see the need to demonize a modern interpretation

What I'm saying is that we should be very careful about making absolute statements. When we say, "this text is logically incoherent," (paraphrasing OP) we are asserting that only the interpretation which is not consistent with the issue we're pointing out is valid, and that's what I'm taking exception to.

Which is exactly why women find most guys lacking. I'm not trying to hookup with anyone who is able to give me a lambo but I *hate* making $20/hr. The complacency about it is the worst part. They're okay living in shitty multi tenant apartments and not doing anything with their lives. Or they are upset about their circumstances but refuse to do anything to change it, like go back to school or get a certification or literally anything. $20/hr between 2 people who are like that would be okay. But I'm not ordinary. I don't want ordinary. And I'm tired of supporting people who make less than me in every relationship. This is why I started sugaring in the first place. Because if I was with some guy who only made $20/hr, I wouldn't have been able to quit my shitty abusive job, go to school, and have all of the things in my life that I have. I would have no one to rely on but myself. And that fucking sucks for a relationship.  posted to submission: "80% of women on dating websites Report that the men are Below average"

>You seem to look down on Malaysia as inferior to your new home. Yet for a 'resource and human rich' country the US managed to get Trump as a president possibly with Russian manipulation playing a role.

First, these words are straight out of the Russian playbook:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism

Second, Trump has said a lot of things that make people angry. But can you name anything he's done for the past 1 year that actually negatively affected everyone? A policy or law is what matters in the end, and so far we haven't seen much from Trump, which is exactly what the US system is designed to do. The President alone is helpless. He needs the House, Senate, and Supreme Court to back him (along with all 50 State governments).

For example, the FCC decided to abolish Net Neutrality protection rules. So what? Now we are seeing State governments pick up the FCC's slack to protect their State.

>Talking about easily abusable system how about the American system that treats corporate entities as people and bribes as 'freedom of speech'.

Erm, "corporate personhood" is too complicated a topic to explain to someone who doesn't understand the American system. But you can read about it here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood

But summary is as follows: It is actually a protection for you too. It's how you enter into contract with a corporation (e.g., employment, services). Without it, you cannot have a contract with a corporation, because it'd be legally the same as entering into contract with a table, chair, or dog.

Also, come on la, do you really think lobbying money is the same as money masuk poket?

Normally its pretty good at it, given enough context, and corrects images automatically. Without that context people's brain had to guess. Sometimes it guessed correctly that thw white balance was yellow leaning and they saw a blue and black dress. Sometimes it guessed incorrectly and assumed that it was cool lighting and a bit of shadow for a darkish blue white balance and saw a yellow and white dress. From this picture we can see how context can really shape our understaning.

[18:58:59] Comment: dywzsv9 by Radical-Empathy : I'm drawing from the Dutch system here, which is my own and one I'm familiar with. Now:

Your first point is wholly valid, but I feel like it is weighed against the largest benefit of PL-PR, which is that everyone's vote counts the same no matter where it is (unless you're Australia or the UK, in which case you elect a parliament from districts, because fuck you). Though in our system a party member can leave the party and keep their seat, they rarely get the chance to be re-elected. 

I also find some recognition in your second point; our governments basically only collapse due to internal problems. Parliament has a way to depose one (Motion of No Confidence) but it is rarely employed except in the worst of cases. In fact, there is currently a scandal going on with the executive hiding documents from Parliament, and nothing will happen because party discipline among the coalition is high. (Also, the judicial branch here is not co-equal to the other two: the role of upholding the constitution is mostly filled by the First Chamber of the legislature, which is elected by the provincial authorities). 

The problems with intertwined executive and legislature come out easier in a highly partisan state, but they are very noticeable here, because of one little party called the VVD. They're a conservative liberal party, the biggest party in the country, and plagued with scandal. Why do they keep getting seats election after election despite this? There's no alternative for many voters who don't want to vote for people who are either batshit racist or kinda socially and environmentally progressive. The people like the ideas they bring to the legislature but their executive work is bad, but they will not be punished for that.

However, I don't know of a system that I personally feel better in. The UK system and the US system both elect the executive and the legislature through (pseudo-)random allotments of seats among geography, which has bad results for the country (gerrymandering, winning the popular vote but losing the election). A separate executive causes stagnation when the legislature is elected during an executive term, where the voters want a different leadership but cannot vote out the executive and cannot change the laws without controlling the executive, and then besides, when partisanship is high the executive and the legislature may as well be intertwined because a congress/parliament will not act as a check on an executive of the same party.  posted to submission: Is the United States Too Big to Govern?

[18:59:14] Comment: dywzsvg by THE_LORD_HERESY : >I can‚Äôt comment on content at all until Tuesday all I can say is the game has you accompanying various characters and you live out the day with them each time. So when the day begins again, everything is back to square one. Saying that, I personally had no issue with variety.

So you can't say if there is enemy variety or bosses? The Devs recently told me here that the game does have bosses. I simply want to hear it from a non dev.

>
Regarding issues. I don‚Äôt recall having any. I completed the game yesterday and I didn‚Äôt encounter anything during playthrough. Saying that, there are a few things we were made aware of which are being resolved in a day-one patch. So as long as those are fixed then I can‚Äôt see there being any on launch - or at least any that break the game/progression.

This is nice to know as there were several areas in Stories where you could get caught in the geography and have to reset the game.

>Regarding exploration issues - I‚Äôm not quite sure what you mean?

The level design in Stories wasn't the best. There are times when you should be able to backtrack in certain areas but can't due to "elevators" no longer coming down/going up and other things. This has nothing to do with the game mechanic of time and getting things on another run, either.

[18:59:45] Comment: dywzsw5 by Monsoon_Storm : Seems to be confusing the "hollywood version" of.... well everything really... with facts.  Churchhill was a dick in many ways, Brits know this.  It's a recurrent theme every time hollywood releases some kind of "historical film" it gets denounced as bollocks.

However, one glaring ommision to all of this is the fact the British people were also undergoing rationing at the time, and dying from those pesky bomb type things.  Stockpiling for the forces in Europe, whilst bad for everyone, will have been seen as a necessity as no\-one knew how long this war was going to last.  To imply that the troops were well fed and living a life of comparative luxury is just as offensive.

How would India have faired if Britain had ended up in the hands of the Nazi's? Eastern Asia was torn apart by war, Europe was torn apart by war.  Captured countries were massacred. Was what happened in India right? Absolutely not, nothing was right in that period.  However, it seems a little unfair to imply that all of this was done almost maliciously when the rest of the world had other issues to deal with. 2 million people in a famine, 50\-80 million in a war.  Choose your poison.  India is also a large country there is no mention of what was done within the country to alleviate that region's issues, there's no way in hell the British took every scrap of food made, there was other mismanagement at some level, British or local.  If China's great famine is anything to go by it was probably a nasty combination of both.

After an arc with one girl is complete, story just resets and you start new arc with a different girl. Basically every girl gets her ending with the MC without any harem and every route is shown. You have to watch second season too to get more story for them and for the closure for all of them. It's great! 

After you finish the whole anime you can pick your favorite arc and watch it again. That's what I would do :)

[19:02:37] Comment: dywzx28 by Manarnar : Even as a small child, I loved to read, but when I was in the 5th grade, I found a copy of H. G. Wells' **The Island of Dr. Moreau** in my Christian school's library. It seemed interesting and I wanted to check it out, but the librarian freaked out, talked about how they never should have had the book, no one should read it, and that I wasn't allowed to check it out. She set it aside and informed me that it would be disposed of. 

You bet your ass I took it the second she left her desk. It's the one and only time I've stolen a book, and I've never regretted it. At that age, it blew my little mind, and completely expanded my literary horizons. I will always credit that book with changing my life.  posted to submission: Weekly FAQ Thread May 13 2018: What book made you fall in love with reading?

[19:05:14] Comment: dyx03ug by Ploppy50 : From a basic finance theory point of view- the price can always be manipulated. Its just a matter of to what extent. For example, if you place a sell order for $1M right now, you will drop the price down a certain amount. If a lot of people conspire to sell large amounts of bitcoin over a certain period of time, they will "manipulate" the price lower. Same thing with buying.

Now regarding gov't/bank etc rigging the price: Keeping the price low would require selling a lot of bitcoin, but once that runs out it's over. I'm sure the gov't has a lot of  btc from the silk road confiscation and buying. But I think the population of civilians hold most.

If the gov't wanted to manipulate the price higher, they could certainly do that, as they can print as much money as needed.

Because bitcoin is a 24/7 Market with very little regulation and barriers to trading it should continue to act as a free market, the price should be reflective of the fair value of what individuals are trading at.

Regulation, like we see with the stock market could only hurt btc in my opinion. If you have ever signed up for a trading account on TD Ameritrade or the like, you will see why buying or selling btc is much simpler, and something anyone can do. posted to submission: Can the market price of Bitcoin be manipulated?

[19:06:16] Comment: dyx03vg by Darkreaper48 : Points do change with each General's Handbook.  The primary focus of this is to balance things that are overpowered, and give a helping hand to things that are underpowered.  While Kurnoth are very strong, they have been around since the 2017 GHB and did not receive any adjustments there, so I think it's unlikely that you'd see any changes for 2018.

I'd definitely start with the Start Collecting, though.  At bare minimum, Dryads and Branchwyches are solid enough they'll never be a bad choice, and Treemen were already hit with the nerfbat once and are still pretty good, so I anticipate they won't get touched for a while.  I'd work on assembling and painting these because the new edition is coming out in June, and I doubt you'll be completely finished by then.

However, if you are, the biggest thing I'd be worried about isn't points changes, but rules changes.  Currently, Kurnoth with bows are really good because even if they get locked in Melee, if they're in a forest, with mystic shield, they have a 2+ rerollable armor save and can functionally ignore whatever they're in melee with and still shoot around the board.  In the new rules, that will not be possible, and may remove some of their strength.  I can't see swords/scythes getting made worse, so if you're planning to build them that way go ahead.

TL;DR - Start Collecting will always be good. If you're super worried about it, rules changes are less than 45 days away so wait and see what shakes out, but I doubt the changes will be so drastic to Sylvaneth that you won't be able to use staples like Dryads, Kurnoth, and Treemen posted to submission: I‚Äôm thinking about getting in...

Der junge Koch sagt:

Zutaten:

Reduktion

* 4 EL  Essig
* 8 EL  Wasser
* 15 Pfefferk√∂rner
* 2 Schalotten

Bedarf f√ºr 1,25 Liter

* 10 Eigelb
* 10 EL Wasser
* 900g Butter
* Salz
* Zitronensaft
* Cayenne

Material | Arbeitsvorgang | Begr√ºndung
---|---|----
Pfefferk√∂rner (zerdr√ºckt), Schalottenw√ºrfelchen, Essig, Wasser | zum Kochen bringen, auf 1/3 reduzieren und abseihen | Geschmacksstoffe werden zun√§chst ausgelaugt, dann konzentriert
kaltes Wasser, Eigelb | zusammen mit Reduktion verr√ºhren, in m√§√üig hei√üem Wasserbad aufschlagen, bis sich die Masse allm√§hlich verdickt | Wasser k√ºhlt hei√üe Reduktion, verhindert vorzeitiges Stocken. Schlagen bringt Luft in die Eigelbmasse. W√§rme bindet und gibt Stand.
zerlassene Butter | warme Butter zun√§chst tropfenweise unter verdicktes Eigelb schlagen | zu rasche Zugabe hindert Emulsionsbildung und kann zum Gerinnen f√ºhren
restliches Wasser (10 EL) | immer erst nach erreichter Konsistenz der Sauce zusetzen | Beigabe von Wasser erh√∂ht Aufnahmef√§higkeit der Eigelbmasse
Zitronensaft, Salz, Cayenne | zugeben | Geschmacksstoffe der Reduktion werden erg√§nzt. M√§√üig w√ºrzen und salzen, da Grundsauce.

[19:07:18] Comment: dyx0905 by SpeedFlex : A pass rushing OLB is usually in a 3-4 defence which operates differently than a DE in a 4-3. An OLB can delay blitzes, drop into pass coverage, and rotate with regularity putting strain on the OL who has to block him. A 4-3 DE has to set the edge, then rush the passer almost every play. In JJ's case, he plays DE in a 3-4 system which operates closer to a 3-technique defensive tackle. JJ can create pressure from the inside and is often met with double teams or RB help in the pass protection.  posted to submission: If J.J. Watt is done right now, do you think still make it to HOF?

3. Mobs get a bit more health, sure, but between the two of you you'll be doing *at least* 2x the damage.

Multiple Elemental Storms do not stack for 2 reasons:
1. "x reduced" does not stack. Only "-x%" stacks. (see the [cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vw7I9fTSqtx9s3a4WVvkgiOGZ7leM81n1H1RrwrOzLc/)).
2. Multiple instances of the same named buff/debuff do not stack; only the highest level version takes effect. To make the most of your pairing, pick different classes with different auras but complementary damage types. posted to submission: Looking for advice (DLC & duo)

In general though, you don't want your disks to ever spin down.  Spin up and spin down are far harder on the drives than leaving them running usually.   If your disks only spun up once a day, maybe, but if that was the case, why not just put your data on SSDs and be done with the spinning media.   posted to submission: Zfs speed limit on 1gb Ethernet?

But they‚Äôre also not going to become some weak and ineffective social movement. What I and a lot of people have a problem with are the liberals that say exactly what you‚Äôre saying now. ‚ÄúIf they did it this way, then I could support them. If they calmed down a bit and bended a knee to authority, then I could support them. If they weren‚Äôt so mean to the flag and the police, then I could support them.‚Äù 

Black Lives Matter is not about winning some small policy change. It‚Äôs about broader black liberation and the dismantling of the current political and judicial system which criminalizes blackness in any form.  posted to submission: Russian Trolls Were Obsessed With Black Lives Matter

[19:09:32] Comment: dyx0dv5 by uzernayme5 : Was at the their game vs Dallas yesterday. Not much involvement, a couple bad touches/passes to go along with some good ones. The most clear thing to me was the frustration at how often his teammates would take a bad touch, make a horrible pass/cross, or just be standing still when Zlatan had the ball and wanted to make a pass. With the game at 3-2 he hit a rocket FK onto the post, which was his only real attacking involvement. You can tell he has quality way above the level of play here simply just by seeing how calm and poised he is on the ball compared to, well, everyone else, but the lack of effort/interest shows just as much.

Having said that, it's clear the MLS is still riding the Zlatan wave. That was the highest attendance at an FCD game in two years, and it felt like half of the stadium was there to see him play (the people behind me lost it every time he did anything, *Zlatan would make a normal square pass* "did you see that?! that was amazing. he's a magician").  posted to submission: Zlatan has lost 4 consecutive matches for the first time in his career

[19:11:50] Comment: dyx0jek by UltimateWeiner : That‚Äôs nothing remotely like this situation. For one, that Napier story is one of the biggest myths in NBA internet lore. LeBron said basically as much about him as he‚Äôs said about Donte DiVincenzo during this tourney run. As time has passed this story has continually become more exaggerated. There‚Äôs zero proof Riley drafted Napier because LeBron made him do it. Riley has always preferred older more accomplished prospects like Shabazz.

As for Simmons, they‚Äôve spent much of their last three off seasons training and bonding together. LeBron just watched Napier on TV and liked his game, it‚Äôs unclear if they‚Äôd even met prior to the Draft. Simmons is Rich Paul/LeBron‚Äôs premier client. By forcing him out of Philly they may as well shut down Klutch Sports. How could any athlete ever trust their agency again?

I know Boston fans despise LeBron and believe all of the worst propaganda and mythology surrounding him, but trust me on this one. If LeBron doesn‚Äôt want to play with Ben (which is a supreme blog boi take), he‚Äôll just go somewhere else. He‚Äôs not signing there and forcing a trade of the guy who‚Äôs been recruiting him for two years and who is going to make Klutch Sports tens of millions of dollars. posted to submission: [Pompey] 76ers are "prepared to do whatever it takes" to sign LeBron this summer

[19:12:54] Comment: dyx0jf9 by C0wabungaaa : I don't think there's really a "normal" campaign with a "normal" flow in terms of dungeons. It all depends on the kind of game you want to run and that your players want to play.

For instance, the first campaign I really ran was around 18 sessions of which one session was spent in a "dungeon", which was just the sewers they had to use to get out of Waterdeep unseen in the first session. The rest was one big overland adventure, heavily inspired by Rosemary's Baby. I'm also currently running an overland campaign that's heavily inspired by the show The Terror, so it's more... overice than over*land*.  I had a small campaign for another group a year or so ago that was some subtle, political-ish stuff within a city, trying to discredit or otherwise 'remove' certain political opponents of their patron, which also had no dungeons whatsoever.

On the other hand, that first group right now has been playing in dungeons for about 75% of their next 'campaign.' The first being an Alien: Isolation-ish inspired crashed floating city, and the second one, of which I got home like an hour ago, is a crime boss' mansion they have to steal a ring from. They expressed a desire, after the first campaign, to try out more Indiana Jones-ish dungeon crawling so I obliged. I have another group that's heading towards a yuan-ti dungeon.

So yeah, it differs heavily. There's a lot of flavours you can run and you're in no way obliged to use dungeons. You can do anything between your campaign being one big mega-dungeon to no dungeons whatsoever. posted to submission: How often do your players actually enter dungeons?

[19:14:37] Comment: dyx0jgl by NYCGayBanker : First: In NO WAY are you ugly - let that go. We‚Äôve all been there, trust me. Unfortunately gay men can be horrible and shallow. 
Just be clear about what you want. 
If you want sex (which is TOTALLY fine!) then you may want to focus on working out, staying fit. Yes get some better pics (they‚Äôre not horrible, but everyone is expecting good pics these days), and focus on being a good, enthusiastic lover. That will have guys coming back.
As an older gay friend told me when I was young, youth and beauty are fast and fleeting. There is a hotter, better looking guy with a bigger dick right around the corner. 
Kindness, personality, confidence and character are what matter. Those are the qualities that will find you someone who wants to stick around.

[19:16:21] Comment: dyx0pdt by whistleridge : Actually, all of the research says, manual labor can work the most, and thought labor can work the least.

This makes sense, if you think about it: we‚Äôre literally evolved for physically activity, not cerebral stuff. If you‚Äôre digging ditches, your only limitation is muscle endurance - people in developing countries can and do work like that 80 or 90 hours a week for decades. But if you‚Äôre designing high efficiency switches for Space X, you‚Äôre probably not at your peak genius for more than 30 or so hours per week. 

Also...trauma takes a heavy toll. Your job isn‚Äôt to answer the phone, it‚Äôs to guide people through an astonishing range of traumas, all day, every day. You may not be the direct victim, but you‚Äôd have to be a sociopath for none of that to rub off on you.  posted to submission: I'm a 911 Dispatcher, most day's when I leave work, I'm completely and totally mentally and emotionally exhausted

[19:16:25] Comment: dyx0pdv by dantraman : There's a handful of very well known new player corps, either aligned with new eden's major powers or independent. The big ones are Pandemic Horde, probably best known for having incredibly relaxed recruiting standards and massive amounts of content, but not being the safest place to make isk. There's Brand Newbros and Brave Newbies who are somewhere in the middle and Karmafleet who live in the safest space in the game for making money but you'll need to be more proactive to get your PVP content, it's still there you just need to be looking for it. The other one of these is Eve University, who specilize in teaching new players, but aren't affiliated with any major new eden power. All of these corps are easy enough to get into, with pandemic horde being the easiest (You'll likely be accepted within hours at the most with no interview or anything) and eve university being the hardest, that may take a few days.


There's also dozens if not hundreds of newbro friendly corps from all over new eden, in everything from Hisec to wormholes. The corp recruitment forums are a decent place to look for these, the in game corp finder is mostly useless however.

[19:17:07] Comment: dyx0ped by wheres_jaykwellin_at : The only thing I have to go off of is the miscarriage of justice that was the Dominique Dunne case. She was the actress who played the oldest sister, Dana, in the original Poltergeist.

Boyfriend was abusive (so much so that when she played an abused woman on an episode of Hill Street Blues, she didn't need any bruising making applied). She finally left him, but he continued to stalk her. One night she was going over lines with a fellow actor for *V* and her ex came by. He proceeded to strangle her to death in her driveway for about three minutes.

His charges were eventually plead down enough due to the "heat of passion" defense and he was sentenced to six years and only served three-and-a-half.

This is mostly just a watered down version of the events. The entire thing is absolutely heartbreaking to read.

So, yeah. I believe that a man *could* have had a lighter conviction.

Not to mention it also ignores pre season wins.

Considering how like 75 percent of the player base doesn't have a win I'm better than you give me credit for. Stats mean nothing.

[19:17:47] Comment: dyx0uit by Arth_Urdent : Somehow these articles and discussions tend to ignore how focal length really relates to vision and go with a fuzzy "it looks natural". In the end it comes down to what a natural viewing distance for an image is.

Imagine you take a picture with a 50mm lens on a 36x24mm frame (aka 35mm format). Now print out that picture 36x24cm big, stand in the same location as the photo was taken and hold it 50cm from your eye. The image will seamlessly integrate with the environment. Meaning the perspective etc. present in the print is as if you were looking through a window that size from 50cm distance. It literally reproduces your vision in terms of perspective. If you do the same experiment with a 100mm lens you can do the same except that you either have to print half as big or hold it at twice the distance for the "perspective to match" when holding it up to the real world.

So the choice of what a natural focal length is comes down to what a natural viewing distance for the final photo is. For a computer display that is probably about the width or diagonal of the screen. For a TV on the other hand it is probably more like 2-4x the image diagonal. Framed images on a wall fall somewhere in a similar range depending on print size. So arguably in many cases 70-100mm would actually be "more normal" than 50mm. But it's not a hard science after all. Especially because we look at different subjects differently. A frame filling portrait taken with 50mm will seem a bit off since we usually don't look at other people from "kissing distance" but rather a distance that is multiple times the "height" of their face. Hence longer focal lengths are appropriate. A landscape on the other hand we are pretty immersed in so taking a wider angle picture and looking at a wall filling print from relatively short distance makes more sense... posted to submission: How the 50-mm Camera Lens Became ‚ÄòNormal‚Äô

[19:18:01] Comment: dyx0uj7 by Bardali : > Please provide evidence of that. Because as far as I can see, you literally just made up this "fact" on the spot.

I can't literally quote every Israel historian or political leader. But you can look at Moshe Dayan's account of the conflicts which Syria where he writes around 80% if not more of conflicts were started by Israel. Or Egypt with Nasser whose primary concern was tranquility on Egypt-Israel's border. And the series of traps Israel tried to get Nasser to walk in so they could retaliate, going as far as invading Gaza and killing 27 or 28 egyptian soldiers. 

> Um, I'm an Israeli who literally lives next to Moshe Dayan Road. I have a feeling I know just a little more than you about this ;)

I doubt it. If you want I can give you the quotes from Benny Morris' book on this, if you are interested. 

> For anyone else reading this: Moshe Dayan was an Israeli minister in the 1960's,

He was also quite open that Israel was seeking conflict and war with both Egypt and Syria at different times. Now, he isn't personally all that relevant in the current discussion, it just shows the myth often build of Israel trying to live in peace with its neighbors. When it's clear from the historical record Israel is almost always the aggressor, and when **Israel wants peace** only then peace is established. Which goes all through 1967 to the Lebanon War in 2006, to the campaigns against Gaza.  posted to submission: Hamas Leader Implies 'Hundreds Of Thousands' Of Palestinians May Breach Israel Border

Especially all the people telling me I'm a terrible daughter for not wanting to talk to her or spend time with her. When I was 8 years old she told me out of the blue that she has never felt any maternal instinct for me.

[19:19:30] Comment: dyx0ukf by magicallion : I'm still having a lot of issues as my stoma site is inverted and the stoma itself tends to lie on one side, which creates more chances of pancaking and mishaps. 

Through an average day I'm emptying my bag 6 times and most of that is watery output. My diet is good and tends to be more mush as any roughage can lead to pain, discomfort and minor blockages. Although I wear a deep convex bag with a belt, at night I can have accidents due to all of the above issues. 

This is only heightened when I'm on holiday, as at times I am unable to stick to the strict diet I set out for myself at home. Sometimes if I am in pain, i will change my bag just to relieve the stinging, burning sensations that happen. During my holiday I did this 4 times. Then on the thursday evening, we splashed out and had a beautiful BIG meal with wine. When I got back to the apartment, I realised the seal to my bag had broken, so I changed it. At 1am I woke up to a mess of a bed and had to change him again. Then at 3am the bag broke again (a human error, on account of my panic at 1) and then I posted on here, with just one bag left as a back up. 

Hope this clears things up. 
On a normal basis I tend to change my bag every 18hours, as I'm a chef who works long hours in a hot kitchen. I see my stoma nurse every 6 weeks and she's on hand if anything else goes wrong.  posted to submission: Travelling and down to one last bag...

[19:19:32] Comment: dyx0ukq by Stevo182 : One of my dream guns is the HK Socom Mk23 due to its iconic use in the first Metal Gear Solid game. Of course its not something that would be practical to carry, and a lot of other handguns make more sense even as a combat role. But it looks so sweet, especially fully loaded with tac laser and suppressor. The only other guns from entertainment that really speak to me are all fictional (Deckard Cain's gun from Blade Runner, Vash the Stampede's guns, etc) other than probably the PSG-1, also from Metal Gear solid.  posted to submission: For fun discussion: Have you ever bought a gun because you saw it in a movie or TV show?

[19:19:48] Comment: dyx0z8f by MadusMaximus86 : When I built my new rig a month or so back literally the ONLY things running along side Rust were Steam and whatever Windows 10 runs by defauilt in the background, yet I still got these stutters. I still do.

My system is an i7 8700K, 32GB of DDR4 3200MHz RAM, 860 Pro SSD and a GTX 1080. This doesn't happen nearly half as often on ANY other game I play, even other Unity games (though I do notice similar annoyances in other Unity games). Rust is the least consistent when it comes to performance.

I can run it on fantastic preset with 100+ FPS at 1440p then it'll randomly drop to anywhere from 2-20 FPS for a second or so, for seeminlyg no reason. There's no single thing that does it all the time, it's just random. posted to submission: Optimistaion

[19:20:56] Comment: dyx0z9s by Helassaid : There's a lot more to cardiac care than oxygen, aspirin and bolus diesel. If the patient is a simple cut and dry STEMI with associated symptoms, sure a rapid transport by BLS might be beneficial. But what percentage of AMI patients present STEMI with a stable rhythm and blood pressure? Less than half of all AMI patients present STEMI to begin with, and patients with more advanced cardiac disease are more likely to present NSTEMI and have more life threatening associated symptoms.

Besides the more obvious problems EMTs would have in treating aberrant and/or life threatening rhythms because of their inability to start IVs or push medications, another part of our job is to make patients feel more comfortable by alleviating some of their symptoms, which includes providing them with some medication options that would reduce their pain - which themselves introduce another host of potential complications.

Personally I think the EMT-B level as a standalone license in inadequate for today's landscape of EMS provider, and that EMTs should be all educated to at least the paramedic or EMT-A level. I think that EMT-B as a license level actively holds EMS back into the 1970s perception of "medical taxicab" because the education standard and scope of practice is too limited. posted to submission: I had a code save this morning!

[19:21:23] Comment: dyx0za3 by MarioThePumer : Time for PHYSICS

Gravity is not a constant, but rather something that exists within every object. Every single object that has mass, from an atom, to a planet, has a gravitational pull *(Yes,* ***you*** *have a field of gravity surrounding you)*.

The thing is, small objects' Gravitational pull is so insignificant that it can be completely ignored. *Large* masses's, however, cannot be ignored.

For example, the sun. All the stars in the solar system are in orbit around it *(which is a fancy way of saying "we're falling towards the sun but just fast enough that we don't get any closer" but that's a whole different subject)* because of it's immense gravitational pull.  

So, basically, gravity in space wouldn't be taking you to a specific destination, but rather, it's like a bunch of kids fighting over a ball - your destination at any given moment is whoever is currently dragging you towards them, but you could just as easily be dragged toward a bigger planet at any given time.

[19:22:25] Comment: dyx12y1 by Vagant : Every game up to and including XII is great. The peak of the series would have to be the range from IV to VIII. The games before are classic, the games after are great but not very interesting in comparison, with the exception of the stellar XII.

As for the best ones, gameplay-wise it has to be V for its depth alone. When it comes to story and characters, VII or VIII. posted to submission: Final Fantasy Peak?

[19:23:28] Comment: dyx12z2 by AutoModerator : Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

[19:24:10] Comment: dyx1868 by LiAbAl : the bolt threads on the opposite direction so it won't back out during use. Skilsaw mag77 is designed for right handed people, the bolt threads on from the left side of the tool and thw blade spins clockwise as you're looking at from the left; so the bolt for this is not threaded  in clockwise (righty tighty-lefty loosy would be wrong here) but instead is threaded counter clockwise. i said all of that to get you thinking. 

your saw looks like a classic saw and in that case it would thread on clockwise so as the blade turns counter clockwise while you are looking at it from the right it causes the bolt to tighten itself into the arbor. your bolt may be seized up. I'd recommend some jb80 over wd40 to loosen it up posted to submission: Got this saw from a friends father and I can‚Äôt get the bolt off to change the blade, even with copious amounts of Liquid Wrench.

[19:25:03] Comment: dyx1873 by CPT_H : If it wasn't for the community forcing Raven on everyone to do things like NS/IF/EL and BT/DKV/FAS/SJF, new players would have plenty of gold. I'll give you IF/EL not being super new player friendly mechanic-wise, but you can get the legendary soul off of doing DC + NS and weeklies over the course of the event. 

Everyone's arguement for it being expensive for new players/alts comes down to pushing Raven/Rift before they have the gold income for it. Weeklies with BT is what 120g a week? And you save potentially save on souls/RK mat. Then you have another 10 to 15g from dailies in Sogun's, MT9-15, EC/DT/NF/NS. 

For ES, find 3 other newbies you can trust (or I don't know, some clan members maybe?) and split the cost of making 20 to save some gold. Even better if you wait until you have some mats from WC to reduce it even further. Spend any extra time you have farming peaches in the basin while practicing your combos/iframes, do the bosses when they spawn for chances at evolved stones you can sell for 12-14g each (change the channel for a chance at an addition boss each spawn), while getting more mats and assembling keys for void fragments from the treasure room.  

Its not impossible, the people making it hard are the players; from stupid gear requirements to a general desire not to do anything without getting some kind of boosted reward from NC posted to submission: Forcing people to do IF and EL but making it way harder to gear up for them

Yes, City lost a few games, but otherwise they were utterly dominant, winning almost every other game. Similar to current Barca. 

Whereas Arsenal had a lot more draws.  posted to submission: Man City break the record for biggest title winning margin in the Premier League with 19 points separating 1st and 2nd place (Previous was 18 points, Man United 91 points and Arsenal 79 points in 1999-2000)

I wouldn't mind if I'd had a good bite over past 10 years but I've only really been able to start investing with any real money relatively recently.  From 2008 I earned less and prioritised paying off my modest house as home security felt important to me.

[19:27:55] Comment: dyx1cuk by yalllove : A year ago I thought life was meaningless but I find I have a handle on it now.

High level, it‚Äôs obviously to awaken and to ascend but it‚Äôs also to experience this life. I am here for a reason and it‚Äôs a very beautiful planet with many wonderful things. So I try not to take anything for granted - my life may not be perfect but I now believe it‚Äôs exactly as it should be, and when change comes I welcome it too. Going with the flow but yet not living on autopilot.

And also loving all people without exclusion, seeing all people as perfect children of God/Source and as my beloved siblings. Forgiving situations, self, others. Looking within and finding self. I find our lives are filled with encounters and situations that are lessons, everything here is designed to bring you home.

[19:29:14] Comment: dyx1grq by zaltd : Why is XRP called so if it is truly separate from Ripple? So I get the X, it is standard for all currencies and assets/commodities (think gold and silver et al) but why is that followed with RP if it is truly separate from Ripple? It has been said XRP was created before Ripple and was gifted to them so did Ripple rename or rebrand it? 

Surely if Ripple want to truly distance themselves from XRP because of any implications from the securities talk, XRP (which one would presume stands for Ripple) has to be renamed. By design it currently translates to Ripples‚Äô currency or Ripples‚Äô asset.

This symbol and 99% of other include at least the R some have X, R, and P. Maybe something that excludes the whole XRP would be better suited. I like the drop design posted to submission: Another XRP symbol concept. What do you guys think?

First it's only one Author. 2nd, he is talking about the origin of scriptures. He's just saying God inspire prophets and they are not making things up, he's not saying prophets repeat God's words. "interpretation of things" means interpretation of life, not interpretation of what God said.

[boop] (https://imgur.com/a/yWRKYsf)

first and last upper body pics are a chest/back day pump (first one is about a month old).

The rest are after my arm day today so no chest/back/leg pump.

I know calf pic is shitty but perf for my shitty calves.

What do y'all think my bf% is? I'd guess around 12-15% (calipers said 9 but they don't test my love handles enough)

Current plan is chest/back,arms/shouders,legs repeat, one rest day. High intensity, lowish volume (about 6-8 sets per body part per week), med frequency (though I guess high for arms).

I'm gunna keep dieting down try to get even less fat while trying to bring up my arms even more (and calves, my quads dwarf em).

[19:30:27] Comment: dyx1jwo by -smrt- : He's literally advocating for terrorism. If the leader of Iran was doing the same thing, the right would be outraged.

He's not saying "we don't ever want civilians to get hurt but that is unfortunately a risk we take when we have to fight terrorists". He's saying we should "go after the families", i.e. purposely target non\-combatants. Targeting non\-combatants for a political or religious goal is widely known as terrorism.

Even when civilian deaths are entirely avoidable, he sees no point in avoiding that outcome. This is the kind of mindset we're dealing with. I would say we're lucky not to be on the receiving end of it, but when people in these countries see the US killing innocents, bombing hospitals and weddings etc, that just fuels the hatred of the West, which will come back and hurt us again and again. posted to submission: If you are a conservative you are probably a terrible person

[19:30:31] Comment: dyx1jwq by thehardestthing : Who cares about displaying weakness to a person who has already chosen not to have you in their life? 100% I block every ex when I engage in No Contact. Half the people who break No Contact from this sub-reddit are because they chose to respond to meaningless breadcrumbs from the ex that would have been avoided completely had they blocked their ex in the first place. In the early stages, many of us still have hope and I wouldn‚Äôt fault anyone for being tempted to respond to their exes reaching out casually. You learn eventually though after months of receiving and responding to these check ins and follow ups that your ex actually doesn‚Äôt want reconciliation so much as they just want your friendship (in the best cases, which a lot of us are not ready for) or an ego stroke and sex (in the worse cases).

The argument of ‚ÄúDisplaying Weakness‚Äù is revealing of someone‚Äôs need to once again appear a certain way to your ex - I don‚Äôt give a fuck about appearing ‚Äúmature‚Äù or ‚Äúweak‚Äù to someone who has already made the decision to leave me. You‚Äôre still trying to qualify yourself to someone who has already shown you that they don‚Äôt want to be with you. Ergo, their perception of you still matters and your profess is still tied to how they feel about you or how they perceive you.

I‚Äôve had exes come back with me blocking them - through their friends, through work emails, through a different avenue of communication where they were not blocked (email versus phone.) Not once did they accuse me of being petty or weak - blocking allowed me to stay true to my course and never be tempted, it allowed me to focus on myself 100%, instead of analyzing the crap out of lazy communication. 

Self-preservation is not immature; boundaries have to be set. For sure, respond to an ex or entertain texts from an ex if you are well and truly over them but trying to feign indifference when you‚Äôre still hurting is only a disservice to yourself. Your ex will find out soon enough that you are anything but chill and over them when you can no longer pretend in the face of new and hurtful information (that they‚Äôre seeing someone new and/or that they have no intention of getting back together and never did).

Agree to disagree, just think it‚Äôs dangerous to spread this around when as proponent of blocking, I can tell people I‚Äôve had exes come back. Blocking weeds out lazy bullshit and will show you who‚Äôs really serious about having a discussion about reconciliation.

Yeah they do.

1: Is part of an organization bent on exterminating your country/species? Will not reason.

2: Is making demands you can't realistically comply with? Will not listen to reason.

3: Is making realistic demands, and seems peaceful and available to talk to? Might listen to reason.

Etc.

> there are countless ways a hostage situation can play out

No there aren't. Either you kill the hostage takers, they kill some of the hostages and then you kill the hostage takers, they kill everyone and get away with it, or you persuade them otherwise. Most of the time the last option isn't an actual option.

In every example in volume 13, the hostage takers were part of an organization whose sole objective was to exterminate the human race. Listening to their demands or persuading them was a waste of time, because everyone knew their demands to begin with... everyone surrender, and we'll kill/eat everyone as we see fit. The solution was always to disregard the casualties immediately. I don't think shooting at the hostages was useful, but shooting at the people taking them hostage and not caring if you miss and hit a hostage would be. posted to submission: Demihumans be like:

If you don't, harrass distracted enemies for 700 damage, and end game where everyone is low health, start picking up kills.

[19:32:16] Comment: dyx1jxz by AccidentalExistance : i stopped frequent visits to indiaspeaks coz the rancid bjp supporters have taken over the sub. Its not like mods dont know. I tink mods cant do nething. they cant even say 'bhai thoda aaram se'. They are holding the sub at ransom.

These are the only people who visit that sub, so all rules are bent to help them.

As a community they have ganged up, any non bjp supporter is screwed badly because they dont want them around, with logical comments or not. Lucky for me, I am a supporter. 

I browsed through their meta thread and it was laughable at the very least. GuntherGulbien has completely left all commenting and discussions and now made it his sole purpose of stalking and pointing out every mod's comment. I remember he had put one of the mods as "worst mod" in his own sub. haha if this is not witch hunting, I dont know what is.

If you are still missing the forest for the trees, I suggest logging out of your account and looking at densely commented posts. The amount of TOI level comments are extreme. 

The problem with indiaspek is the community, but as in all democracies you cant blame the population. Unke toh 1000 khoon maaf, saari galti neta ki hi hai, 

I remember me and /u/artha_shastra fought tooth and nail to remove gunther from approved submitter list. Who is their right mind gives someone like that such powers? Why dont you shoot up aids up your veins?

It was encounter and rrc who promoted this screwed up idea and literally arm twisted mods. Mods couldnt do anything cos they cant lose members hahaha pathetic. 

/u/Encounter_Ekambaram ji you are banned in randia, correct? Because you constantly try to weaken and shit on that sub, it is only fair. Even if this sub is totally insignificant with barely 30 visiters. 

But you are guest of honor in indiaspeaks who shits on the only sub who is trying to fight back randia with minimal legitimacy. You have several times screwed with their rules and donno what code language you speak with mods. If anyone must be banned, dont you think it should be you? 

indiaspeaks wont make it imo, the community wants to actively keep an randian out. they fail to realise almost every indian who joins reddit mostly visits randia first. even they themselves were randians before they got banned. hahaha

Hipocracy at its finest.

however you look at it, randia has won. it grew from 1500 to 2800 active visitors, and last I checked indiaspeaks active users fell from 350 to 100. and this is the case with a few amas in the past 30 days? If AMAs increase traffic, shouldnt the number be double or triple? and not 1/3rd?? 

Good job logon, bade aye 'concern trolling'. In the garb of virtue signalling you are just fucking the last bastion of Indiaverse. hahaha

atleast indianews was sabotaged by randia mods last year, this one was sabotaged by its own comm. posted to submission: This sub is ruining IndiaSpeaks (OPINION)

I can't remember if it was 2013 or 2014, but I think it was 14 of the Top 16 decks at YCS were Six Samurai decks. More recently I think it was somewhere in the ballpark of 20ish Spiral decks in the Top 32 at the most recent YCS.

Since Yu-Gi-Oh doesn't have a rotating format like most other TCGs, the meta is always scaling vertically because if the new decks are not objectively better than the old decks, nobody is going to buy/play them.

So what ends up happening is 2-3 decks end up getting played predominately while 1-2 fringe decks see occasional play but never make it very far. posted to submission: [Fluff] Sylvans won MCS.....

Racial slurs aren't excusable just because other people don't care about them.

A big part of the reason why people are so much more comfortable with Redskins over other racial slurs is because Native Americans are such a small part of our population, and they are effectively segregated away to where no one sees them.

But people's opinion rapidly changes when they are in fact face-to-face with Native Americans.

[19:34:08] Comment: dyx1qbr by LRonPaul2012 : > You give one payment to the mafia protection racket they are coercing

There is no penalty or punishment for refusing to sign a W-4 form.

You probably won't get hired if you refuse, but you're also no worse off than you were before.

Failure to receive a benefit (i.e., being hired) is not coercion.  The problem is you're trying to define coercion as, "I can't receive the benefits from signing this contract without paying the cost."  Which is how most transactions work in general.

"I don't get the benefit of owning a car unless I agree to pay for a car, therefore, paying for cars is coercion." posted to submission: Taxation is voluntary

[19:35:08] Comment: dyx1qc9 by theringinginmyears : You can make review and approval of all condo documents at your sole discretion a condition on your offer to purchase. Your realtor has a standard list of documents that should typically be requested including reserve fund studies, board meeting minutes for the last 12 months, bylaws, budgets, capital reserve, insurance, etc. You or your lawyer can review. Don't let your realtor give you advice on the content of the condo documents. Get your lawyer involved early before removing conditions on your offer.

Anecdotally, I have also heard all the same warnings about this building already listed (structural issues, mechanical issues, mold, cash calls, etc.). I believe they are all true. I think that rental rates are very reasonably. You may consider renting instead of buying.  posted to submission: venu living Red Deer

And that's finally what got my social security card back. I mean, everything.

Storm Arrow acts as a deterrent to flankers, and the best tracers can reliably use their movement to counter that...

[19:38:40] Comment: dyx2138 by James_Null : > what happened exactly during majora's mask that made everyone so upset?

Everything. I know that sounds like hyperbole, but if I'm honest, it kind of was everything. A short list of the problems people had:

* Arin still doesn't understand/use the controls (Z-target, shield, a couple MM specific functions like some mask abilities, etc.) despite the basic control scheme being featured in every pre-BotW Zelda game as well as many non-Zelda titles
* Arin doing basically no side quests in the Zelda game about side quests. One of MM's big defining features is that the NPCs have lives and schedules and such
* Arin mocking the very idea of collecting stray fairies, which give you very helpful upgrades (this would come to bite him in the ass later on). Any stray fairies he did collect were an accident and prompted him to go on another minor rant about not collecting them
* Arin frequently got lost and/or didn't understand simple tasks despite having a very detailed walkthrough *right fucking there*
* Arin would occasionally get pissy about people complaining and having to play the game "right"
* Several episodes with no progress (some even with *negative* progress)
* Arin consistently playing poorly and blaming the game for his own incompetence
* Arin claimed to love MM, then admitted to hating it, then claimed hating it was "just a bit," then proceeded to prove that he did in fact hate it
* Arin ended the playthrough at the miniboss for the last temple because he couldn't beat it (see previous ass-biting comment) and went out with a several minute rant about not only not liking the game, but not liking *the fact that other people do like the game*

Those last two points are the biggest reasons people were so upset by the end. If you want more information, I'd recommend looking through the episode summaries by u/S_G_Redbear. They're pretty detailed and a lot more entertaining than the playthrough that inspired them posted to submission: [Long] I really can't handle watching the Grumps anymore...

They said Pep can't win PL or his style won't work in England. Many reasons were given but he proved everyone wrong & did it. This time he didn't have a Robbery & competitive edge of Bayern, this time he didn't have Xaviesta, Messi & competitive edge of Barcelona, this time he was competing with equally rich teams unlike in Spain or Germany, this time he did it in league that feels  proud of it's physicality. This time he didn't have protection of European refs. This time he did it a style & dominated the league like he did in Germany & Spain. I'll love to watch the face of all those pundits & journalists.

If you execute your play well then you'll win. Pep's team did it constantly. Yes, he signed many players but none of them were super expensive or superstars. He bought good players & made them superstars. First 100 pointer in top most competitive league while playing attacking & beautiful football. We witnessed history folks.

[19:39:11] Comment: dyx213z by SpanishDuke : A Fascist will answer 'an end'. The State is the supreme *t√©los* of a Fascist society.

However, I myself adhere to the Falangist view of the state - as an instrument towards an end. The Falangist state is totalitarian (in the original sense, a Schmittian *Totalstaat*) economically and politically. However, the state is only a true state insofar as it furthers the Nation as a Unity of Destiny in the Universal; a common Enterprise.

Regarding your point about sociocultural norms, I disagree. While I wouldn't outright ban homosexuality itself, tolerance towards this kind of behaviours has led to the state of decay that we have today in the West. In a Fascist (or related) society, parasitic behaviour would not be tolerated. This is not to say that homosexuals and liberals would be executed, of course. In Fascist Italy, peaceful dissidents were simply barred from holding public office or working in state media; they were not only allowed to live, but also allowed to keep working privately. In Francoist Spain, after the obvious immense tension that followed the Civil War, executions were limited to violent communists and outright terrorists (ETA, GRAPO, etc). posted to submission: Set me straight on The State: A means or an end?

If you can't, the match shouldn't have to drag on because of you.

As for your point on E Sports, that's an entirely different scenario. It's round based, so a lost match can be accounted for by getting a win afterwards. As well as this, they've got hella $$$ on the line. I wouldnt quit either lol posted to submission: MERCY RULE: There should be one.

[19:41:39] Comment: dyx261j by tradinghorse : Do you really think a bunch of Generals approached Corsi and told him that they were planning a coup? Or, are you saying that Corsi's boasting was inadvertently taken seriously by some black hat operator, who was suddenly apprised of the generals being behind DJT's ascendancy?

The matter of the military support has been public knowledge since the Calm Before the Storm announcement. Why would Corsi's boast - real or fiction - trigger a hit, to send a message, at that particular time? 

I think Corsi is as dark as they come. I don't think his boasts are true. He has, for a start, known affiliations, of which MI would be acutely aware. Would a bunch of generals, planning a coup, approach this man to reveal their plans? Why?

If they did this, they would provide immediate and powerful leverage to Corsi's affiliates. Perhaps, reducing them to the status of pawns to be bartered for certain objectives. This would make the generals' position incredibly weak.

I think Corsi is absolutely full of it. Look at some of the other people indirectly in his orbit. Zack, Q team strong man - who has not the first clue what's going on (listen to his "inside intel" after the missile strike). AJ, who speaks to Q while playing golf. You could not make it up!

And it would all be innocuous, but for the fact that Corsi was running an agenda - backed up directly by AJ. Last I saw, they were going to ditch Q, because Corsi was tired of blending his valuable, but not classified, inside intel with his Q decodes.

Wouldn't want to inadvertently mix Zack (high-level, "named", identifiable, inside source) up with Q - who is anonymous (An anonymous disinformation AI, that makes "human errors"). Of course, Alex knows all about "sock puppets", so it could all be true. posted to submission: Corsi may actually have blood on his hands.

I can't say for sure that I have anxiety, or depression: I was never allowed to get tested, and since moving out (I now share a flat with my little sister and some friends) I simply haven't had money. 

I have a parent- well, step-parent - who this reminds me of. I still have trouble expressing things and admitting feelings because it simply wasn't something I could safely do as a kid. They're a much better person now, and are raising their own kids and finally taking responsibility for themself. But there's still the feelings of fear, betrayal, distrust... 

I lost my old as hell car when it got towed from a Walmart after being unable to start.

Amy Schumer's personality and delivery just don't do it for me. I was laughing so hard I cried during Michelle Wolf's stand up.  posted to submission: Live Discussion (May 12, 2018) Amy Schumer / Kacey Musgraves

[19:42:38] Comment: dyx262p by IceColdHatDad : I work in catering which is very similar (literally a buffet that we bring to the events)

* There's a good chance that the cake or pie you got was just a thawed out frozen cake, as in the same kind you can find in the freezer section at your local grocery store. 

* If you want to get lots of free food, befriend someone who works in catering and give him some freezer bags before they start their shift

* You know those delicious as fuck appetizer meatballs? It's only 3 ingredients: 1 part Chilli sauce, 1 part Grape jelly, and a bag of frozen pre-cooked meatballs

* Unless you're the kind of person that is okay with gas station stuff, don't eat the hotdogs or hamburgers. 

* EVERYONE in this industry cuts corners, with the *possible* exception of the guys at the very highest and most expensive tiers (who not even the 1% can afford, they are 0.1% territory). If we didn't then we'd never get anything done on time and the service would be even more expensive (and it's already pretty expensive as is). That said, I'm happy to say that the one I work for is one of the better ones in the area fwiw

* The best populations to serve for in my experience are blue collar workers (company Xmas parties). They are all very polite folks that are usually pretty patient and low maintenance.

* The worst populations to serve for in my experience, consistently across the board, are middle-aged uptight businessmen/businesswomen. Always gets **way** more food than they can actually eat so their plate has this massive mound of food waste on it that is impossible to stack other plates onto, never drinks water throughout the day so they ask for refills on their lemonade/Arnold Palmers constantly, looks at me (the server) with a stack of 13 plates and thinks "yeah, it's okay for me to ask this guy to take my plate for me right this second", always at least one guy who brings their kid with them to the benefactor party or wine meet-and-greet who is bored out of their mind because everyone else was sensible enough to leave their kids at home (and if you've been invited to one of these events then you can *absolutely* afford to hire a sitter), you often times have no choice but to butt into their conversations to ask if anyone wants their plate taken/a refill/any special assistance because you can stand over their table for 5 solid minutes and these non-inclusive douchenozzles will never even notice that you exist, the list goes on. posted to submission: Buffet workers of Reddit, what is something everyone should know about buffets?

[19:43:00] Comment: dyx262v by higginsthebrave : Most shootings are not premeditated. They are committed by upset people, often drunk, who take their gun and shoot someone with it. These people aren't 'criminals' in the sense you are thinking of, where they went out to get a gun and commit a crime. They are basically regular people, kind of shitty and emotional unregulated or even abusive people, but still people that there are tons of in this world. Unregulated or nearly-unregulated gun sales allow guns to be everywhere, within easy access to drunk and angry/shitty people like this. It creates tons of crime that would NOT have happened if there weren't guns everywhere.  posted to submission: What are some hard pills to swallow in life?

Don't live in city heights, be prepared for outrageous rent, ocean beach is chill while Pacific beach is usually closed due to sewage from Mexico. Super dog friendly, there's a bunch of dog parks and 3 dog beaches, balboa park is gorgeous, gaslamp is chill and fun, Coronado has mootime ice cream which is bomb.

[19:45:47] Comment: dyx2cb9 by Kichigai : #Context

Trump's comments (as linked) came as he imposed strict new tariffs on Chinese industries. According to [the White House fact sheet issued the same day] this included "aerospace, information communication technology, and machinery." The fact sheet quotes Trump as saying "under my Administration, the theft of American prosperity will end. We‚Äôre going to defend our industry and create a level playing field for the American worker ‚Äî finally."

However this morning, [President Trump tweeted this:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/995680316458262533)

>President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!

[Archive link if needed](http://archive.is/TrHyT).

Instead of worry about American workers and American companies he is now worried about Chinese jobs. Unironically, [Jacob Wohl hailed this as "promises made, promises kept."](https://twitter.com/JacobAWohl/status/995680611011457024) ([Archive link](http://archive.is/o2gX3)), though I don't ever recall Trump lamenting the plight of the Chinese worker.

Even wilder is that the reason imports of ZTE handsets have been down is because [Congress deemed them a National Security threat](https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3472316/huawei-zte-china-spying-house-intelligence-committee), with Mike Rogers chiding them for intellectual property issues, a topic cited as why Chinese tariffs are necessary.

As if the fact that the President is seeking to simultaneously reduce trade deficits while helping a Chinese company export more to the United States, he is promoting ZTE, a company that directly competes with FoxConn and it's [InFocus brand](https://www.androidauthority.com/foxconns-little-known-secret-infocus-570423/). Why is that important? Because [FoxConn is building a factory in Wisconsin](https://walker.wi.gov/foxconn-chooses-wisconsin). So Trump is helping a Chinese company that hires Chinese workers compete against another Chinese company that employs Americans and produces products for American companies, like the iPhone.

So this is bad for American companies, bad for American workers, bad for American national security, and is in direct contradiction to his goal of lowering the trade deficit with China.

It's also bad for companies based out of our allied nations, such as HTC (HQ and manufacturing in Taiwan), BlackBerry (HQ in Canada, manufacturing in Canada, Hungary, and China), Samsung (HQ in South Korea, manufacturing in South Korea and China), Apple (HQ in United States, manufacturing in China and Brazil, attempted manufacturing in US), and Nokia (HQ in Finland, manufacturing in Finland, Hungary, and Mexico). posted to submission: "We‚Äôve lost [...] 60,000 factories in our country ‚Äî closed, shuttered, gone. Six million jobs, at least, gone. [...] I‚Äôve asked [the Chinese] to reduce the trade deficit immediately by $100 billion. It‚Äôs a lot. [...] But we have to do that." 22 Mar 2018

[19:46:38] Comment: dyx2cbw by biganthony233 : I dont think yield protection is a real thing with purely stats alone, especially if it is your state school, wont happen I bet. 

Yield protection really IMO happens when high stats like a 3.8\+ 517\+ person mixes with no real ties/interest to the school area. For example, if someone from like California or Colorado tries to apply to a school like NYMC, Loyola, or Rosy Frank in Chicago. If they have no real ties to the area\- they are unlikely to go regardless if they get another acceptance, which is likely with their stats, so the schools will reject. posted to submission: How to avoid getting yield protected out of my state schools?

44&#37; of homeless people have lived here long than ten years which means 56&#37; moved here in the last ten years. What I was getting at is West Coast cities often times absorb homeless people form other places because our weather is so much more moderate and less extreme than say Chicago, thus they can live outside longer.

Then, like 5 years later I was at a Phish concert in the parking lot tripping my balls off, feeling stuck because I didn't really want to be there but was too far gone to leave, when what could best be described as the brownest sort of sound churning out of this guy's radio going straight into my nervous system and licking my soul. I went up and asked the guy who it was and he said "Ween" like I shoulda known, and I was hooked from then on.

‚ÄúIt is 2018. A petty man on the Internet describes me as a Dr Manhattan ripoff. I feign injury, but in truth I no longer feel the barbed taunts of Reddit.

It is 2011. I proudly turn on my pre-owned microwave, a bargain I found on e-Bay. Something is wrong. The microwave emits a blast of energy. I am destroyed.

It is two weeks later. A phantom looking exactly like me briefly materialises in the women‚Äôs locker room. I can see a lot of boob and it is awesome. I disappear.‚Äù posted to submission: What is a warning sign that a movie is going to be bad before it comes out?

Personally, I like his ambient series and his other ambient work like Eno and Cluster. As well as the Berlin trilogy (especially the back side of Low) and the Talking Heads records he worked on.

4. Resident Evil
5. Farpoint

top 5 psvr experiences

1. Superhot 
2. Rec Room
3. knock out league
4. Sparc
5. Sprint Vector

Sure their are more games but nothing that will really keep you coming back for more than once cause of terrible content and quality. Hopefully we get some new stuff soon like alvo and firewall.

If you read OP's point it's that abortion should NOT be outlawed. You didn't dispute that you just said it's forcing people to live by,  "Father knows best!" \(which I've never heard of before and a google says it's just an old fashioned sitcom\).

Ironically, it's anti\-abortion law which is forcing people to live a different way. Passing legislation to limit women's rights is forcing women to do something. Outlawing legislation limiting women's rights prevents this.

How you hand this point to republicans doesn't make any sense here. The democrats clearly won this one. posted to submission: CMV: The United States does not have a two-party system, it has a one-party system.

[19:52:15] Comment: dyx2nti by DollCrying : In a house I used to live In, one wall in the lounge backed on to a small walkway to our back gate with a fence shared with the neighbour.
Now the lounge wall had a little window, the sofa was opposite and the tv was between the window and sliding doors that opened to the back garden.

Now, the house had a large drive so was set back from the road and was (obviously) detached from the neighbour.

This led to me not having to give a single fuck aboit where I took off my clothes, or where I had sex.

One lovely sunny day, I had some jodphurs on, sexy knee highs, shirt with a whip in my hand (consensually) beating the crap out of one of my partners at the time, who in turn was completely nude excepting a thick collar.

I glanced up at the window and saw a wisp of white hair flapping lazily in the breeze above the fence. My heart fell out my arse. My eyes sloped down and I saw an eye staring straight at me through the fence and I fucking freaked.

Laughed in disbelief and ran upstairs.

No one else saw his beady little eye. He did it a couple more times after that when I wasn't doing anything even mildly erotic. Just sat watching tv in a frumpy dressing gown.

The last straw came when I saw him watching me whilst I was visibly very upset. I threw open the back door, grabbed a garden chair, pooped my head over the top and told him he better fuck off or his wife might find out about his fetish for watching young girls through a hole in the fence.

He didn't do it again. posted to submission: What is your creepiest/scariest ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being watched‚Äù moment?

Changing the topic entirely:

Who knows. Maybe ministers aren't very good with numbers. Maybe they did find out about this but didn't care at all. Honestly, both of those things are likely with the present government.

> I kind of switch off when I hear the government quoting stats, they seem to be able to make them say whatever they want

This sort of thing is a bit of a problem. The stats themselves don't lie but most people who use them do. I do think it's really worth having a look at these sorts of numbers yourself and trying to come to some kind of judgement. Ignoring the statistics entirely and accepting your favoured narrative from your [politician/party/whatever] of choice seems to be the prevalent attitude in politics on all sides at the moment, but I don't think it's particularly healthy.  posted to submission: Nearly half a million 'hidden' young people left without state help to survive and find work, ministers warned

[19:53:34] Comment: dyx2nus by heavensteeth : Glad you‚Äôve got some of the gw paints, I find they last forever (just pick out the dried bits that stop the lid from closing) and I also use their spray (about one can for a small army, you only need a light dusting for the next base coat to stick). 

I would recommend a range of brushes, I destroy my basecoating one every six months, but have had the same w&n detail brushes for years. Don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúminiature‚Äù range of Windsor newton they lose a point and don‚Äôt hold enough paint. Be sure to water down your paints a little, a couple of coats is normal for light colours over black. 

Up to you on the money side of things, if you‚Äôve been getting great service at the store then I would support them. I get most new release stuff at my store as I game there, but go to Craigslist/eBay to add to my forces later on. I feel it‚Äôs rude to game at the store and not buy anything.

Be prepared for frustration when painting, it‚Äôs normal. Just stick to the GW undercoat/base/wash/highlight formula and you‚Äôll be pleased with the results. If your son wants to branch out into glazes and blending later he will have a much stronger feel for the paints and skills to build on. Don‚Äôt be discouraged comparing your minis with others, and remember the models may not look great individually but once an army is painted up it‚Äôll bring a smile to your face.

Grab: either he has magnesis fill in as a janky tether or loses his tether grab entirely

Final smash: stasis; freezes opponents for a set time, where Link can freely hit them. They get launched with all of the accumulated knockback once it ends.

Anything else not mentioned will either only be altered aesthetically (Bow) or go unchanged entirely (spin attack, virtually all normals) posted to submission: Let‚Äôs predict BotW Link‚Äôs moveset.

It rewards positional play, also nothing stopping those players with spawn protection from shooting you.

Also, I only hear about those things through subs like this. I never heard of any pizza sex cult until you people started talking about it. Maybe you're the ones spreading the conspiracy theories?

[19:56:16] Comment: dyx2v69 by phoenix25 : I would let her have sleepovers with other girls, but just keep the door open.

She needs to still be able to have friendships platonically with her friends - you don‚Äôt want her to feel punished for coming out to you.

Your daughter is still going to encounter other girls in change rooms, bathrooms, etc. She needs to not feel like the ‚Äúpredatory lesbian‚Äù - which is the EXACT message you would be sending her by banning sleepovers. Not only that - but you would also put that message into her classmates heads when she tells them that‚Äôs why she can‚Äôt have sleepovers anymore. You would definitely be opening her up to bullying with your message.

So: business as usual, just with the door open. After all nothing about your daughter has actually changed, just your perception of her has.  posted to submission: Parental question regarding my bisexual 14 year old daughter

[19:58:47] Comment: dyx31fa by ___Rand___ : As a long time fan of Raps watching this team almost every game, it was the coach who keeps failing them in playoffs. Every game 1 of playoff series the team comes out flat, the offensive game plan was always pedestrian just like regular season gameplan, can't make adjustments until game 2 or game 3, and STAYED with ISO too damn fucking long. And look at the Cavs series - THREE FUCKING YEARS IN A ROW. It was the Cavs' THREE POINT SHOOTING that kept killing Raps, and he didn't put out a plan to DEFEND the three. Is it because Raps can't defend the three? NO - they SWEPT Rockets in the regular season this year. They know how. Casey gets fucking BRAIN FART when he faces Lebron and all the logic leaves his brain.

[19:59:05] Comment: dyx35mf by egraces : I used to work at a restaurant that had a weekly "charity steak" deal, where a steak dinner was marked down significantly (less than $10) with the purchase of a drink, and $1 of every purchase went to a different local charity. Great deal, awesome cause, but it was absolute hell for the entire staff.

The kitchen had it bad enough: turnover was so fast they worked their asses off just to keep up, over a blazing hot grill, too. The front of the house had the real treat, though, in dealing with the customers. 

People would drive from over an hour away to get to the deal, people who usually couldn't afford to go out to eat, and then milk it for every penny. I'm talking about people who asked for two salad dressings, just because they could. People who made you go through the entire beer list to find the very cheapest one for them (we stocked 450 in house, and rotated them regularly). People who would shout about anything they could think of, and then tip less than a dollar, or nothing at all. 

I have so many stories from that steak-night hellscape.  I still have nightmares - not kidding.

[19:59:31] Comment: dyx35nc by iDontReplyToAtheists : > it's you who is needed for food, warmth, shelter..

My body *is* needed.

Hypothetically, if someone said to me: I'll provide you free food, free housing, and everything you need for the rest of your life, but I want something in exchange. After you die, all your organs have to be either donated to science or transplanted to people who need them; also, when you're old and on your deathbed, say age 80, either shortly before you die or shortly afterwards, instead of dying a natural death, we want to euthanize you, drain all your blood and donate that to someone in need. Also, the rest of your body which we don't need, we want to use to feed lions in a zoo.

Hypothetically if someone that to me I'd think it's a pretty good deal. I get to live a cushy life for 80 years or so and only at the very end do I die, which is what would happen anyway; and as a bonus that death benefits a lot of people.

This is how humans should be treating cattle: a cushy life in exchange their death being made good use of. posted to submission: an interesting title..was jesus vegan or vegetarian?

[19:59:33] Comment: dyx35nf by dia_Morphine : > But how is it successful? In places where hate speech is outlawed, hate groups are still able to organize, but now they have the argument of oppression on their side to grant them sympathy.

Because other countries aren't the US. Because the point of this isn't to completely prevent racists from organizing. Why do you keep acting like if this isn't an absolute fix it's worthless?  

>It seems to me like most violence would be premeditated since, you know, it is way easier for violence to benefit you if you plan it out strategically. How many altercations occur that are the necessarily result of escalation from hate speech?  

Does the use of race-based hate speech usually end in violence? Fuck no. That's my point. My entire point of banning hate speech is to essentially force people to "put up or shut up" to achieve the same results that they can accomplish with hate speech and have to also risk actual punishment for doing it. Right now you don't have to physically assault someone to get them off the train. If hate speech were illegal and they used the same language to accomplish this that they could use now, there would at least be consequences for their actions.   

You probably believe I can't punch you without violating some sort of right you have, right? You wouldn't agree with the argument that my right to bodily autonomy trumps your right to well-being. This is the same with 'free speech' like this. My right to say whatever the fuck I want doesn't trump the right of others to exist without living in fear due to their race.  

Do you not agree that pure 'free speech' can actually inhibit the free speech of others? Why do you disagree with that claim?  

>This is an argument for why you should never be able to insult anyone. Should I not be able to make fun of someones appearance at all because that might make them feel too bad to enter a public place?  

The fundamental difference you are missing is that hate speech targets protected classes. That's what makes it hate speech. This is not a novel idea. We literally have laws defining this.  

>This is literally not true. It is the fact that people sometimes follow through with threats that make them corollary with violence that makes threats worth anything. Correlation does not equal causation. Threatening and/or hateful speech does not necessitate violence, and violence is not necessarily preceded by threatening and/or hateful speech. That's the central point.  

It doesn't fucking matter if they will actually follow through. And the fact they probably won't fucking defends my entire point of banning speech that is used as a form of pseudo-violence. What matters is the intent and how the other fucking party interprets that hate speech. So again, the fucking train example: if the black dude walks on the train, a racist white dude says "you don't belong here etc etc," the black dude hears language that is directly associated with a history of violence, and so the black dude has to make a decision - either board the train and take a risk of having to defend himself, or skip the train and wait for another.  

Here are all the scenarios: Dude misses train, dude boards train and nothing happens, dude boards train and gets in a fight. In one of these the racist dude gets consequences, and that's only when he fights. In all of these the black dude is forced to deal with bullshit, and two only had to do with *hate speech,* not violence. The first one, he misses the train because of it, not wanting to take the risk. That's not fucking on him. The second one, even if nothing came of it physically, he still rode a fucking train in fear. But for some reason it's the third one that's the one that supposedly only matters to you.  

>There is mountains of evidence to suggest that steep punishments do not cause worthwhile deterrence.  

Oh come the fuck on dude. I said "steeper," as there are literally zero punishments for hate speech that isn't charged as a hate crime. Literally anything is "steeper" than what we do now. That's absolutely fucking retarded. So, let's just pretend, you don't think the risk of a year in jail is going to stop people from using hate speech? Do you think everyone that fucking uses it is deeply entrenched in fucking white supremacy and willing to take those risks for a deeply held ideology? They're fucking not. Again, the entire point of my argument isn't directed at *STOPPING* these kinds of people, it's about being able to actually *PUNISH* them. The people it *IS* about stopping are those that say racist shit just because they can but are too much of fucking pussies/dont actually hold extreme belief systems that would push them to make these risks.  

>It isn't a bandaid so much as it is chemotherapy applied to 100 people who might have cancer to cure only a few that do. The ONLY way we will fix this is better education.   

Except "not being able to say the n word with impunity" isn't a consequence even closely comparable to the side effects that come with misusing chemo. That's absolute bullshit. Literally all this does is prevent you from using language that targets marginalized people based on the traits that marginalize them.  

So unless you (wrongly) believe this will turn the US into a dystopian, authoritarian state because of hate speech laws, or that "being able to say the n word" as a human right trumps others rights not have to live with the consequences of having that language used to oppress them, or that Dank-like examples of "jokingly" using it and getting consequences outweighs the benefits of curbing actual hate speech, unless you believe these things are true and can explain why, I don't see how you can make this comparison. I don't see how this can be anything but a net positive.  

>I would argue this point: The entirety of society, as it exists, is a threat to marginalized people.  

Welp. Fuck me.   

>A gang of white people in a racist area are an implicit threat to black people WITHOUT EVEN FUCKING SAYING ANYTHING.   

What the fuck is a "racist area?" My point is to be able to punish people for intentionally using racist fucking language. What the fuck are you even on about.  

>But this isn't actually doing anything to keep anything in remission where it does exist, and it won't do anything to remit anything where it could be applied. The only thing that will fix it is actual education, not some law that does nothing to do anything to solve the actual problem.  

You really think we could ever "fix" education, and you really you think that could "fix" racism? Are you serious? And how the fuck is what I said "doing nothing" to stop this when I continue listing ways it would? Explain *WHY* I'm wrong.  

>White people are still going to be racist jizz twizzlers (is this me dehumanizing white people so much that I might want to actually kill them? OH NO SOMEONE ARREST ME FOR THE IMPLICIT THREATS I AM MAKING TO WHITE PEOPLE)  

Because "banning hate speech" would be an abstract idea with literally no reasonable conditions guiding how to categorize, identify, and prosecute it. "People are still gonna break into homes LOL WHY BOTHER."  

>they are going to insult and threaten and attack black people no matter what  

"people are going to rape and murder no matter what"  

Jesus fucking christ dude. Just stop.

[19:59:52] Comment: dyx35np by OrkfaellerX : Also, to give you a very basic run down of the Warhammer world in case you aren't allready familiar.

At the beginning, the Warhammer world was a cold, mostly lifeless rock floating through space. This was the 'Time of the Great Ice Age' and lasted for atleast a hundred thousand years. Only a handfull of races existed back then, most prominently the Dragons and the Dragon Ogres.

At some point 'The Old Ones' arrived. The Old Ones were a super advanced race of space faring aliens, they pushed the planet into a new orbit closer to the sun and began bioenginiering the world's primite life forms.

Over a span of several hundred years they create a series of servant races. [The Slann](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/8/8b/Slann_Colour_Jasper_Sandner_Illustration.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151231183445) who used their magical powers to terraform the planet, the [Skinks](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/7/76/Warhammer_Lizardmen_Skinks.png/revision/latest?cb=20161004055351) as craftsmen and scholars, the [Saurus](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/1/18/Warhammmer_Lizardmen_Saurus.png/revision/latest?cb=20160905225924) for personal protection, the [Kroxigors](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/2/2d/Warhammer_Lizardmen_Kroxigor.png/revision/latest?cb=20161005020903) as pack mules to assist construction of their temple cities and the [Amazons](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/0/0c/Warhammer_Amazon.png/revision/latest?cb=20170326052538) whos original purpose has been lost to the ages.

With their help the Old Ones created a foothold on the planet and the first civilzations; this is 'The High Age of Technology'.

Over the next couple thousand years they also created a series of other races for reasons not entirely known, but it is speculated that they were trying to create a warrior race capable of oposing the forces of Chaos.

Chaos is the ultimate evil of the Warhammer universe. It springs from [the Realm of Chaos, or Warp](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/3/36/Waves_of_the_Warp.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160211182552), an immaterial dimension in which space and time flow differently. The Warp is [very lovecraftian in nature](https://youtu.be/HTr5CjpSp-g?t=30s), its a dimension so beyond mortal understanding that everyone ( and everything ) that gets in contact with becomes the subject of madness and mutation. Everything it touches is irreversibly tainted.

The Old Ones created the Elves, Dwarfs, Humans, Giants, Ogres and Halflings - all failures in someway or another in the eyes of their creators. ( Orcs and Goblins were introcuded to the world by accident due to Green Skin spores that infested the ships of the Old Ones without their knowledge. )

Ultimately, the Old Ones' work remained unfinished due to an event called 'The Great Cathastrophe'.

The Great Cathastrophe was triggered by the explostion of the [Great Polar Star Gates](https://i.warosu.org/data/tg/img/0460/58/1458162710229.png) that allowed the Old Ones to travel between the stars without the need of their ships. The explosion flooded the Warhammer world in Chaos Energy and mutated early men and animals populating the regions arround the poles into all kinds of beasts. This was the moment of birth of most fantastical creatures in the world, everything from Pegasi, Hydras, Griffons, Manticores, etc was the result of such chaos inflicted mutation - this also marks the emergence of the Beastmen.

From the ruined portals the [Daemons of Chaos emerged](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/c/c7/Warhammer_Lizardmen_Defence_of_Itza.png/revision/latest?cb=20161016225333) emerged. Daemons are semi sentient entities native to the warp. In their own realm they are shapeless, just sparks of energy in an occean of raw magic, but in the material realm they take the appearance shaped and defined by the ideas and fears of mortals.

It was hell on earth, and the daemons of Chaos flooded the world like a tidal wave. The Old Ones fled on their space ships leaving many of their servants behind. The remaining Slann rallied the Skinks, Saurus and Kroxigor behind them and put up a desperate defence. The Slann took position on top of their pyramids unleashing the full potential of their magical abilities. They raised oceans, cannyons and mountain chains swallowing entire daemon armies whole - while surrounded by loyal Lizardmen who gave their lifes selflessly as the Daemons scaled the steps of their pyramids.

Ultimately it was Elves who saved the world with the creation of the [Vortex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeT_dPTas7E), that sucked the excess magical energies, and with it the daemons, back into the realm of Chaos.

The Lizardmen empire was in ruins and all the Slann of the first Spawning, the only ones who had ever been in presence of the Old Ones, had fallen. The Lizardmen lost their knowledge of technology and the plans the Old Ones had for the Warhammer world and devolved into backwards ruin dwellers. Only the Amazons still hold the secrets of the Old Ones and are sworn to protect them.

In the aftermath of the Great Cathastrophy the Elves and Dwarfs spread across the Warhammer world and enter their own high ages becoming strong allies for a thousand years.

It didn't last. A dispute over the line of succession caused [Malekith to assassinate his brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13SZzkQWAkk) to become Phoenix King in his place. Malekith was rejected by both the sacred flame and his people and forced to flee his homeland followed by those who remained loyal to him. Its civil war and the Elves are split into the Druchii and the Asur.

From exile, Malakith organizes attacks against the Dwarfs making it look like the actions of the new Phoenix King. Dwarfen Ambassadors demand reparation from the Phoenix King, who in return has them shaved and humiliated.

This triggers the 'War of the Beard' that devastates both realms and costs them their positions as super powers in the Warhammer world. The High Elves are driven from the Old World, and the few left behind creat their own Kingdom and become the Wood Elves.

Somewhere inbetween all of this, the Skaven emerge as described in the tale [The Doom of Kavzar](http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Skaven). ( you better read that one for yourself )

The world enters the age of men. In Khemri the first advanced human civilization emerges, [a young priest and sorcerer there will be the one to unlock the secret of eternal life and create Necromancy giving birth to the Tomb Kings and the Vampire Counts.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bqJyIXmDOf4/VWS5cMXIPGI/AAAAAAAAGzI/sHK16Lx7--k/s1600/nagash.jpg). At the same time over at the Old World two warlords emerge  -[Sigmar](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/1/11/Sigmar_at_Blackfire_Pass.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20130921045303) and [Gilles](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/5/5f/Gilles_le_Breton.png/revision/latest?cb=20160305033220)- and unite the warring tribes of men becoming the first rulers of the newly founded Bretonnia and Empire.

Sigmar saves the life of the Dwarfen High King against a Green Skin horde, in return he swears eternal friendship to the men of the Empire, rewards him with runic forged blades and a warhammer and shares the secret of gun powder with them. Sigmar vanishes one day and is believed to have ascended to godhood.

Gilles le Breton is visited by a figure called 'The Lady of the Lake' and his body is claimed by her after his death at the hands of Orcs. The Lady becomes the dominat deity in Bretonnia and many knights dedicate their lifes in her service. What none of them know, the Lady of the Lake is a Wood Elven machination; a religion crafted to turn Bretonnia into a puppet state.

And the forces of Chaos claim the human tribes close to the world's poles where the taint of Chaos remained strongest for themselves, rewarding those willing to march south to bring war to the Old World with great powers and even immortality. posted to submission: Where can I learn more about the warhammer lore?

Assuming you started your car up right after he took that measurement means he is feeling you a story to get you to buy something.

Most batteries (with the engine off) will measure around 12.5volts, and with the engine running should be around 13.5-14volts, some newer cars also have active alternator systems that can disable the alternator when the battery is sufficiently charged, this is done to preserve fuel.

How old is the battery in your car? Replacement is usually required every 5-7 years, it may be a good idea to consider replacing it just based on age, but I would get one from a local auto parts store, because it will be sufficiently cheaper, and only takes about 10 minutes to replace (unless its a newer American car).  posted to submission: Battery measured at 8.7V?

His bike does burn a little bit of oil and so I thought that was it (and was very concerned with it running almost dry). Anyway, I plug it back up and add 3 quarts and call it a day. A couple weeks later my brother notices oil on the oitside of his motor and fairings. Brings it to a shop and they drain over 5 quarts out! Still have no idea how over 2 quarts of oil was trapped somewhere in the engine. posted to submission: This is fine!

Until they actually do something it IS just lip service. And telling prosecutors not to punish state legal dispensaries is more than lip service.

>Is everything viewed through a lens of racism in 2018 to you?

Seriously? You think it's weird to tie racism to racist statements and a protest about racism?

>Also also, can you please explain to me how neo-Nazi's support an Israel loving, Jewish family having, pro-LGBT President?

I've already shown you that they do. Stotp ignoring reality. And Trump isn't pro lgbt, he's done nothing positive for them and a lot of negative. What do you expect with someone who chooses Pence as a running mate?

>he general idea of the government give-aways in the name of helping people is twisted because it creates dependency on the state instead of being individuals who can stand up on their own. 

You're assuming welfare is permanent and not tied to you looking for work. And if you CAN'T provide for yourself at the moment because you hit a rocky patch in life, it's welfare or die in the streets. 

> Expanded welfare hurts - and if you want to see how it hurts, look at the black communities that have been ravaged by families being dependent on government hand-outs. 

You keep saying that but you haven't proven it yet.

>Again your only argument for neo-nazi's supporting him was some people on Stormfront

No dude, you're ignoring more than half the links I gave you. I gave you seven. One of them cited the biggest KKK newsletter. That's still more than your youtube video for one guy.

Hell just look at charlottesville, a bunch of Nazis shown up to participate in a Unite the right rally, so those guys consider them right wing. Hell IIRC it was a Nazi/white supremacist group that formed the rally.

>MS-13 are literal rapists and murderers and have been flooding the US from Mexico

I don't know about that but most Mexicans are not MS-13 so implying that most mexicans are rapists is still BS. By the way a border wall isn't going to stop shit.

[20:03:40] Comment: dyx39r6 by Cultjam : Hold up.  Domesticated animals are bred for physical and behavioral traits. The genetically closer a dog is to a pure breed standard the more definitive and ingrained those traits will likely be.  

Training and socialization can help control breed instincts but it‚Äôs not reliable.  Pits were bred to be animal aggressive and people friendly, which confuses the hell out of the average person because most don‚Äôt know there is such a distinction.  They are mentally tough so abusive/neglectful upbringing doesn‚Äôt affect them easily.  Saying aggressive behavior a result of training is not really true, it‚Äôs much more hereditary.  They were bred to be animal fighters and need to be handled by their owners as such. 

I adore pits but I did have to put one of my rescues down for being highly animal aggressive, she was highly aggressive with other dogs while being incredibly docile and affectionate with people.  In a way it was like owning a hockey player, she‚Äôd go into game mode around other animals.  

Breed standards are not written in stone, they are created for a purpose and should change as the breed‚Äôs purposes do.  Pit bulls are increasingly popular as companion dogs and the breed standard should change to reflect that and reduce the animal aggression traits.

On the other hand, it's really easy for me to just enjoy a Tom Cruise performance even though he's a Scientology zealot.

And then to top it all off, a lot of actors aren't really that different from the roles they're cast for. Because the personality required for the character naturally comes to them.

[20:05:03] Comment: dyx3h7a by serviceowl : It's deeply frustrating knowing what you *ought* be doing and not doing it. A paralysis, of sorts. The advice of "oh, just do it" is often given out without the requisite empathy. But effectively when it comes to these things, there's a sad truth that we do kind of "just" need to do it eventually.

Just picking the lowest investment one \- brushing your teeth, might make you feel a little better.  As another commentator suggested, the little "wins" can be even more important when you're depressed.

[20:05:03] Comment: dyx3h7b by 505hp : You can check steroids forums for references to not going above 25 clomid, 20 nolva, torem 60, but the two week taper is my experience. In fact the nolva 20/10 was probably first mentioned by me because it‚Äôs the equivalent to 60/30 torem that I always run.

Since sarms aren‚Äôt shutting us down, the objective is to just boost test and save gains, and with a long half-life in nolva, two weeks should be more than enough for this. 

Serms are harsh, and we should minimize the amount taken, when anymore is most likely unnecessary for the goal of the user. posted to submission: /r/PEDs FAQ & Rules - Please Read First Before Posting

[20:05:09] Comment: dyx3h7e by stevejust : It's the entire tone of the article I objected to, from the implication that Tesla was trying to hide it from C&D by not giving them a loaner, to the idea that the car loses it at anything over 7/10ths of its capability.  

I do agree that the Michelin Primacy MXM4 tires are not particularly well-suited to the car, though, as I have the 18" wheels with those tires and the car is more capable than the tires are.  But it's also so obvious that is the case that it seems strange they wouldn't at least say something like, we'd suggest drivers get the 19" sport wheels... or... wonder what good summer tires would be like or... something, anything to acknowledge that the tires and car don't match as well as they could.

Then there's just the oddly contradictory stuff like:

>This aggressively minimalistic approach results in some strange and unsuccessful attempts to reinvent the automotive interior. 

and

>We did get used to the lack of a gauge cluster, though, as the only bits of information you really need‚Äîthe digital speedometer and the battery-status graphic‚Äîare well within the driver‚Äôs peripheral vision in the top-left corner of the screen. 

Well... which one is it?  Is it all fucked up, or is it something you can get used to?

Personally, I was in the "it's all fucked up" category of people before I got the car.  I thought there was a good chance I wouldn't like it based on the reviews.  I got used to the interior choices very quickly.  It doesn't take long.  So, having experienced this, it's almost like they're complaining about shit that it takes all of like 6 minutes with the car to get used to, and the other remaining reservations would go away within a few days of ownership.

Overall, the review felt just... a little off.  And I the biggest explanation for why it just felt a little off is, at least, thankfully stamped right on the article itself.

[20:05:21] Comment: dyx3h7m by prosoccer99 : Why hasn't it been implemented? I can't answer that, as there are probably many structural issues at play. I can say that all of the knowledge you need going into medical school is covered in the first 2 years of UG. 

Most Canadian med schools do not even have required prerequisite courses, so why does it matter that someone finish their degree in art history or sociology to get into med school? Why do we need people with full degrees in whatever they want before entering med school? Seems kind of pointless to me. 

In the 2 yrs, you get the stratification of students based upon grades (which cannot be done with any semblance of accuracy in a high school system), and people get into med school quicker, without having to do an extra 2 years, that in many cases does nothing to further your career as a doctor.  posted to submission: Any med school rejects around, what‚Äôre your plans now?

People leave California because you can make a comparable wage somewhere else and still buy a house or live the live you want in general. People move to California because they can‚Äôt make the same wage in another place/social and culture draw.

The difference I see is that I just don‚Äôt always assume people will be originally from the state (especially for work, of course).

There are a lot of Asian companies selling faux leather jackets for around $50 on Amazon. I'm sure some brands are more reliable than others, but there isn't much to go off of besides customer reviews on the Amazon page. Does anyone have any experience getting a faux leather jacket from an Asian company? What was the company, and how was your experience?

And I know a lot of people will read this and want to tell me to just buy real leather and faux isn't worth it, but I know what I'm getting into. Right now unfortunately it's either fake or nothing, so I just want to see if I can get something halfway decent.

[20:06:53] Comment: dyx3h8z by DavesWorldInfo : It's your story.  Only you can write it.

In my experience, trying to write for you from a distance (or any poster asking similarly specific questions) results in something like this:

> "No, that won't work because of 1 and 2 and 3 and I don't like those ideas."
> "Well what about C or D or E?"
> "No, those are too complicated.  I don't like those either."
> "F or G might be something to consider."
> "No.  Geez.  Didn't anyone read my original post?  I said what I'm looking for."
> "Well you're shooting everything down.  It's your story; if you know enough about what you don't want, then why don't you look at stuff that you do want?"
> "If you can't be helpful (and read my mind), then just don't post kthxbye."

Political problems and political (or ideological) divisions are one of the single most common threads throughout all of human history.  Research existing situations, and look for inspiration or actual events you want to adapt into your narrative.

It's *your* story.  Others can't write it for you.  Other writers can walk you through the decisions necessary to write it from afar, step by step.

[20:07:20] Comment: dyx3h99 by Dr_Dankology : >  They said the only people capable of stopping Blackbeard now are the Yonko and Marco.

That comes with a huge detail tho.

Marco also was leading all the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates, he was the strongest party after the Yonko within One Piece because he also had large portions of the former's Yonko crew, that is also a big factor to be considered. 

If we consider that Old Rayleigh is stronger than Marco(and there even can be an argument made out of that based on Kizaru, but just for the sake of the argument now), then he would have had a far harder time to stop Blackbeard because even if he was stronger, he does  not have 11 remaining commanders and a large fleet under him + reinforcments from allied pirates.

So I would take that with a pinch of salt, Marco was the strongest non-Yonko force at that time because of his strength **+** the strength of the alliance and crew he had with him, that's what the Gorosei pointed out. However, individually he could still be weaker than Benn Beckmann or a final calamity or so. But he would probably win against Katakuri yes posted to submission: Katakuri vs others

[20:08:41] Comment: dyx3mry by Plantsaremylife : That's still a wide open area of interpretation. If someone perceives a genocide is under way, then your sentiment gives them carte blanche to initiate violence. Any real genocide will have violence already happening such as kidnapping or forced moves. Responding to that with violence is reasonable and necessary.

The right wingers think there is a genocide being organized in the Western countries against white people, so does that mean they are right to respond with violence? I say no, but I understand your philosophy as well. I just believe in avoiding violence as much as possible. Western values clearly teach many of us differently.

I'm not saying "playoff Lebron" or Lebron in general isn't flat-out insane. I cba to look though my post history for links, but I've said in the past that Lebron has a "gear" that's far beyond any other active player's capabilities and he's unmatched in his ability to lead his team to disproportionate amounts of success.

That's the thing though. Lebron was forced to carry hard in the Indiana series and his team was letting him down. Same thing happened in the regular season, especially around Christmas. Lebron quickly realized that the Cavs were headed off a cliff and immediately started playing at MVP level. Dude was doing everything. posted to submission: Lebron James Playoff PER is 1.5 less than Kevin Durant's and Klay Thompson's COMBINED

[20:08:58] Comment: dyx3msa by AspectOfApathy : One example I came across recently was warlord. He'd mix between running at you and Charging you into the nearest wall for free heavies, or he'd run at you, and when you dodged the charge; he'd guard break.
 If you dodged his charge and he committed to it, he'd initiate his jumping forward attack, negating the punishment. He'd stick to his zone, feinting and headbutting as much as possible. He'd also dodge forward to look like he's about to headbutt, but he'd simply guardbreak the dodge.

The entire fight is counterable, but once again, the amount of guessing and effort you have to commit to  is so extreme in comparison to fighting other characters, it goes beyond fun or fair. It's terribly unbalanced. posted to submission: Conq vs Warden

[20:09:00] Comment: dyx3msc by StygianSoul : Have her read Treantmonk's guide to wizard. It should give her some perspectives on more effective ways to play the class.

As for what to do about the current problem. She has a poorly optimized wizard based on incomplete recommendations and it doesn't do what she wants it to do, and she can't play something else because then she can't play with her friend.

So being that the game is AL and she's already beyond tier 1 she can't remake the character. so there are only two viable solutions that I can see.

1: she comes to better understand what her character can actually do and adjust her expectations accordingly. (reading treantmonk's guide might help). but if her character was truly poorly made then there's not much that can be done...if she has a low int for example then all one can do is put in ASI's to increase it which are few and far between.

2: Convince her friend to play tier 1 with her so they can both start fresh and try a new type of character and style of play. If she wants to be a ranged blaster, then I'd recommend warlock. Sorcerer with twin spells can do pretty good in a burst scenario also. But perhaps she would like playing a rogue, paladin, fighter, or barbarian more if all she cares about is damage. posted to submission: Unhappy player, not sure what to tell her

[20:09:33] Comment: dyx3mt8 by jassmall : As SYDE (the program which BME was based off of) also has the "jack of all trades" aspect, I'll give my 2 cents.

If there is a traditional program discipline that you pretty certain would be your area of focus (for example, ECE/ME/TRON for building devices) then you should maybe do that as you won't be to gain the same level of expertise in those fields in SYDE/BME. (While BME is the only engineering program with some sort of a "medical" related component, you won't gain the same level of expertise as someone who studied biology/health sciences/is a doctor.) Not already having experience in a field in not enough of a reason on its own for it to not be suitable for you.

If you think a year of general engineering at some other university will allow you to figure that out, maybe you should do that.

If you don't see yourself focusing on one particular focus area (within the process of "making medical devices") and like the idea of being more of a high-level designer/project manager who doesn't deal with all of the details on how each component is produced, then BME may be right for you. You will be limiting your career options, but any choice you make would be a limiter and the jobs that you're ruling yourself from (those that would call for you to have a certain traditional engineering discipline) may not be ones you want anyways. Just recognize that getting the jobs you want will take a greater amount of effort. posted to submission: Is BME worth it?
[20:09:34] Comment: dyx3mt9 by aiopsgnaig : It's not hard when you have any level of self respect and integrity. I'd say it must be much harder to get on your back for a dude who doesn't know what your last name is than to want to get to know him better, but I'm not a girl so I wouldn't know. With that being said, I've literally told chicks that wanted to have casual sex with me that I wasn't interested so if I can do it than I would wager it's not a herculean feat for a woman to do so.

With that being said, you have a point for sure. We let women do whatever they want without consequence so the worst of their desires comes out. That's why both genders should have their bad traits shamed by society and have their good traits promoted. However, it's a clear power play that it's the case right now that women do whatever they want while men are attacked for everything. The very fact that I can't even type that women should be shamed for being sluts, something not even women disagreed on in any society more than 50 years ago, says a lot. posted to submission: Glamourising the 'Childfree Life' Ignores Reality for Most Childless Women
[20:09:35] Comment: dyx3mta by Okora : >For one tribe.

Did you even watch the special? Like half the answers you complained about not being answere dint ehs epcial were ansered in the special. No it wasn't one tribe the lion turtles all togethers said it was time to stop protecting humans since a new era has stated.

>Again I shouldn't have to watch interviews to know what's going on. That just means it was poorly written.

The thing is this has nothing to do with the beginnings special though. If you feel upset that it wasn't answered directly you should be made at bryke or tla or korra for not saying it directly. Not targeting one episode in the franchise and say it's their fault. The hunting line could have easily been fit into to either episodes about the spirit library but they choose not too.

>It's one of my many issues with the beginnings specials. They range from inconsistent world building, to shitty ideas and to just poor writing. They had a certain job in the specials and they failed.

What exactly is inconcetant world bulding. Most of your qurks are easily explained and most differences between wan's time and Aangs time are due to the 10,000 year gap in between them.

>Quoted me? You came up with your own versions of my arguments each time never once quoting me. Several times you lied about what I said and never quoted me to back up what you were saying. Go ahead and quote where I said I wanted them to set up all 4 nations.

Nope I quoted you I said over and over that 40 mins isn't enough time to include everything you wanted to get included and that they might have been able too if they made a season for it instead of a special and you said over and over it's just an excuse and that a good writter should have made it workd and the fact they didn't is poor writting. I never lied to you once. Everytime you are to stupid to understand something or disagree you either call it an excuse or a lie. It's pretty old at this point. No matter how much you try to go oh that's not what I meant that is exactly what you meant. Now stop being an ass and let me enjoy one day on reddit without having to listen to you two bit nonesense that a 6th grader couldnpoint out with the mistakes. And no 40 mins sisn't enough time. The point of the special was the origins of the avatar to go off and show all the stuff you want really would make the special look terrible and rushed anyone know a good writter wouldn't do this the only reason why you are saying tehy should have is because you hav a question and you want every little thing explained to you on the show by characters.

[20:10:00] Comment: dyx3r85 by industrythrowaway_ : > The share of registered voters who are Democrats (44.8%) is up slightly from 2013 (43.9%), while the share of Republicans (25.9%) has declined since 2013 (28.9%). At the same time, the share of voters who say they are independent (formerly called ‚Äúdecline to state‚Äù and now called ‚Äúno party preference‚Äù) has been increasing; it is now 24.5%, up from 20.9% in 2013. Our surveys indicate that 46% of those we consider most likely to vote are Democrats, 29% are Republicans, and 21% are independents.

I think it is more ignoring evidence of how a candidate would act and otherwise not taking him seriously that got us to where we are now.  Everyone has to start somewhere, so I wouldn't automatically bar someone based on being new, but rather look at their history and character.  While this is not a guarantee of a successful candidate, ignoring these things is a demonstrated recipe for disaster. posted to submission: Opinion | Renounce Nancy Pelosi, Ignore Donald Trump ‚Äî and Win?

His parents left Iran more than 40 years ago during the revolution. Clearly not fans of the regime.

2) There is no evidence that a "best man" even existed. If you go on Kerry's daughter's twitter page you can see that there was not even a wedding party. The photo is family only.

Please elaborate how a train/bus system to span the entire US would make more sense than cars? Mass transit makes sense in major urban areas, but getting outside of that, the investment makes no sense. There wouldn't be enough riders to warrant the maintenance, etc.

[20:12:54] Comment: dyx3ra7 by MagnusTheGreat : >Do you want people to simply allow potential rapists and murderers into their homes? At no point am I advocating shoot-on-sight. I am simply reserving the right to defend my family with lethal force, in the incredibly rare chance it's required.

I mean, a knife or a sword would do the same. Even a baseball club. 

I just know I would not want a home invader to be able to buy a gun in 10 minutes, without any trace of it happening, then raping my family and killing us. 

>Yes, I also wear my seatbelt in cars and airplanes even though I probably won't need it.

No other Western country has as high a murder rate as the US. And unlike guns, wearing a seatbelt in a car is mandatory. You can get fined for not wearing a seatbelt. You don't get fined for not owning a gun. 

I don't have anything against guns, they are really cool and interesting, but the ammunition is a different thing. Ammo should be regulated really heavily IMO if people don't want their guns to be regulated.  posted to submission: A good gal with a gun

 None of what you described is intrinsically bad in and of itself. What's bad is when girls feel the need to have a lot of sex even when they are not ready, not because having a lot of sex is bad but because forcing yourself is. What's bad about being a twitch cam girl is not because being a twitch cam girl is bad (for the person involved anyway) what's bad is that many of the girls end up living toxic lives devoid of purpose, simply because they think money is the end-all and be-all to a happy life. If their are cam girls out there who legitimately like (or at least can easily stomach) what they do and are generally happy and nice people then yeah, nothing wrong with that. posted to submission: 13 btw

Love this amp. Such a tonal upgrade over the Hot Rod DeVille I was playing for years. Takes pedals well, has excellent punch and sweet clean tones. Had some fizzy high-end issues with my drive pedals going into it at first, but soon realized that on the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù side and closer to gig volume its perfect. And I don‚Äôt need the ‚Äúvibrato‚Äù side as I already have the Flint for reverb and tremolo. The amp is also responding surprisingly well to my POG2 presets with all their expansive sonic range.

The "post before yours" was mine, in which I brought up Miracle Gro potting soil in the context of its being the same product as Promix, only 1/3 the cost.  My post said nothing about Evil Monsanto, or Evil Scotts, or Evil Chemicals, or really anything other than, "MiracleGro potting mix is the same stuff as Promix and is cheaper."

If you're going to cite this post of mine as some kind of official sanction for your post "ripping on" Miracle Gro, then I am honestly puzzled as to how you managed to extract that particular meaning from it.

No, you weren't the first one to mention Miracle Gro in the thread per se, but you certainly were the first one to bring up Evil Monsanto, Evil Scotts, and Evil Chemicals.

[20:16:21] Comment: dyx43yy by NekuSoul : While a capture card always adds a bit of latency, I guess that there are many things that can positively/negatively impact latency. The USB controller can cause issues for example while a 144Hz monitor can alleviate some of it as the average time a frame waits to get displayed gets cut in half.

[20:16:43] Comment: dyx43z3 by manfrominternet : Hi there! 

So I'm trying to build my Sony a7r III lens kit and I'm having trouble deciding which lenses to buy. I'm primarily an architectural photographer (mainly shooting real estate), but I was just accepted into Yale's and UCLA's photography MFA program so my work will have to get a lot more creative and experimental. (I'm not even sure if I should get an MFA. I'm worried that it'll be a waste of $$$, but I suppose that's for another discussion. Maybe you guys can give me your suggestions on getting an MFA, if you have time.)

Anyway, I already have the Sony 90mm f/2.8 macro. I just recently bought the well-known Sony 55mm f/1.8, but I don't know if I should return it and get the Sony 24-70mm f/2.8, especially since the Sony 90mm can pretty do much the same as the Sony 55mm.

So here's what I was thinking:

Option 1:
-Sony 90mm f/2.8
-Sony 55mm f/1.8
-Sony 16-35mm f/2.8

Option 2:
-Sony 90mm f/2.8
-Sony 24-70mm f/2.8
-Sony 16-35mm f/2.8

Option 3:
-Sony 90mm f/2.8
-Sony 16-35mm f/2.8

What do you guys think? Option 3 seems ideal since it's cheaper, but I'd like to have my bases covered. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! :)

[20:17:49] Comment: dyx440i by Wurm42 : *TL;DR: The canal is a big deal because it could allow a lot more military ships to move between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.*

This canal ties into a whole web of geopolitical issues. There's a lot more going on here than taking land from poor farmers. 

The [Bosphorus and the adjoining waterways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Straits) are subject to a multinational treaty, the [Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreux_Convention_Regarding_the_Regime_of_the_Straits), that mandates free passage through the straits for civilian vessels and puts harsh restrictions on warships in the straits. 

When the Convention was ratified in 1936, the Soviets wanted the warship restrictions, since they didn't have much of a navy. Today the Convention is a strategic problem for Russia, since it keeps their navy from freely moving back and forth between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. 

There are also physical limits to very large ships in the Bosphorus; there are places where the channel isn't very deep and there are three bridges over the strait.

Russia has only one overseas naval base, [the Tartus facility in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_naval_facility_in_Tartus), and it's there so Russian ships have a base on the Mediterranean side of the straits. Maintaining that base in Syria has become...problematic in recent years. 

Erdogan's position is that the artificial canal won't be bound by the Conventions, so Turkey would have complete control over what ships can pass through it. The canal would be big enough for modern warships and possibly aircraft carriers, depending on the design of the bridges over the canal. 

That could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether Erdogan is friends with NATO or Russia when the canal opens. It certainly gives Erdogan a lot more leverage playing NATO and Russia against each other.  posted to submission: Erdogan's 'crazy' canal alarms villagers and environmentalists: The 45km canal will link the seas north and south of Istanbul and ease traffic on the Bosphorus strait, a major global shipping lane.

[20:18:26] Comment: dyx4857 by jesuisunchien : > What about them over your correspondence made them of interest to you?

We started out as language penpals on Reddit. I didn't know how to say "oral exam" in Danish and inadvertently ended up making it sound like I was being tested on giving head.... His response was cute and that's pretty much when I knew I was interested in him. 

Other than that, it was nice talking to him because we are like-minded and share common interests. 

> Were you nervous the person wouldn‚Äôt be like you thought? 

Not really. We'd Skyped a lot before that, so I felt like I had a good grasp on who he was as a person. I knew there might be some small differences, but I never thought "what if he's totally different in real life?" I was really worried, though, that he would smell bad to me (see below).

> Anyone meet in person and decide they weren‚Äôt for them after all?

Yes, with an ex. There were obvious red flags as to why we shouldn't have even been in a relationship in the first place before even meeting up, but one thing that I could never have known without meeting him in person was how he smelled. It wasn't a hygiene problem, I just couldn't stand the smell of his natural body odor. 

> Does anyone consider it a benefit to get to know someone online first?

I wouldn't consider it a benefit, it's just a different way of meeting someone.

> How did you deal with the cognitive dissonance (word choice?) of knowing the person online but not knowing them in a physical standing-in-front-of-you sense?

To me, there wasn't cognitive dissonance; meeting them in person was just an extension of getting to know them. He was basically the same person in person, as he was online. posted to submission: LDRs that met online and dated for 6+ months before meeting - what was it like meeting for the first time?

But he still felt the need to message everyone on her friend list it seems to show them how she wronged him and blah blah.

[20:18:55] Comment: dyx485r by TheHolyGuardian : Ever fought on the cusp of darkness, Guardian? Ever battled the fiercest of enemies in the deepest, darkest parts of the universe?

You know, it's funny. There's irony in it all. They call us Guardians, but what are we guarding? Earth has been raped... RAPED by the Fallen and the rabid Wolves that reign over them. We ran to the Moon, first. We tried to make something of the useless rock which orbits what we once called home. The Fallen followed us, to every corner... almost. The only land they would not scavenge was that of something far worse. The Hive. From the life sucking Thralls to the gut wrenching Ogres, they came from the darkness waiting to swallow our light.

Venus was already infested with The Fallen, yet they knew their place. Vex rules this planet now... It's a floating machine. Sure, we concentrated our light on destroying their Warminds time and time again, but to no avail. Mars is no different. The Vex's arms reach here too, gripping the planet with NO MERCY... But another new foe. We thought we had space here, even some time to recover. We were wrong. Wave after wave of Cabal marched over the vast sand dunes. Cabal attack ships overhead, delivering hundreds... if not thousands of Cabal Centurions. Each one with as much experience in war as there are legions of Cabal forces.

It's almost funny now, looking back on it all. See, now the Cabal forces are dwarfed, the Vex's grip has been loosened, the Hive's darkness surpassed and the Fallen's thirst for scavenging light... extinguished. What by, Guardian? A new threat. One which even we may not be able to destroy. The Taken.

Every foe you've slain, every Captain you've eradicated and every leader you've dethroned... have been given to them. Their numbers only increase, even after death. The black cloud of despair is upon us. The Dreadnought, Guardian. It's the source of the black curtain which causes such horror. Lead by Oryx, the Father of Crota, this army is like no other. Hidden away in Saturn's rings, Oryx has quietly bred a near unstoppable force... out for revenge.

So... Gear up, Guardian. Ready your ship. Prime your weapons and call upon the Gods of the Sun, Lightning and Void. May they protect you, and give you strength to fight the eternal fight.

Roll out, Guardian! posted to submission: Potential spoilers? Are the Warmind Engrams once a day, or less?

I don't know what his deed said, but its legality would all ride on whether the government gave him that right or not.

[20:22:48] Comment: dyx4ca9 by green_meklar : >I think this misunderstands how the LVT would work. It wouldn't be assessed on the basis of the unimproved rental value of land, but apportioned on that basis.

No, the idea of LVT is to assess the rental value of the land and set the tax accordingly.

Now, the key point of the geoist proposal is that the proportionality here is 100%. That is, the tax is set at the *full* value-in-use of the land. This would effectively reduce the exchange price of the land to zero, making a calculation of the tax as a proportion of the exchange value meaningless. The assessment would therefore have to be a *direct* assessment of value-in-use rather than being based on exchange value. posted to submission: What does this Forbes article get wrong about LVT?

[20:22:58] Comment: dyx4caf by PeterF8991 : >f I kept a fast every third Sunday of every month and told other people that do you want to keep a voluntary fast?

No, this is a common principle in Islam that singling out acts of worship without textual evidence (i.e.  Quran or Sunnah) is impermissible. This part of hanafi fiqh as well, it's in the books and ask any student of hanafi fiqh he will tell you the same.



>As for the nafl, they are mentioned in the Hanafi fiqh which is why people pray them.


The "hanafi fiqh" isn't anything but a collection of books written supporting certain positions. Bring the original textual evidence, which the hanafi books should mention.

This is one of the major situations that cryptocurrencies are designed for, actually - allowing "cash" transactions between two people without a third party in between that can potentially tell them no. So while it's likely that they'll include cryptos as "cash" under this law and prohibit transfers over that amount it'll be hard to police and I'm sure some people will switch over to using that. posted to submission: Australia Bans Cash For All Purchases Over $10,000 Starting July Of 2019

[20:23:33] Comment: dyx4hpw by kitsunetat : You seems to be confused about how attraction works. People are attracted to physical features first and now they present to the world. The things that are physically apparent. You are basing your sexual attraction of what some USED to be. More specifically how they were born. Which has nothing to do with who they are now. The reason your ‚Äúattraction‚Äù to afab only is transphobic is because you are saying trans men are not men. Because they are afab and THAT is what you are attracted to then you are attracted to the female part. You are at the very core denying who they are. 

Now perhaps you meant to say you are only attracted to people that have vagina which is slightly different. That‚Äôs sexual preference to a physical attribute which is ok. It makes things difficult cause you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in people‚Äôs pants and pre/post op is not something you can predict even if you know someone is trans.  posted to submission: Question on terminology

[20:23:35] Comment: dyx4hpy by DepravedVessel : It's reeallly likely Trump will win the next election. 

A lot of people are happy with the South and North Korean peace talks and it's hard to not give him credit when even the SK leader has done so. 

The tax cuts have seemed to be popular as well and that was his for sure.

The media is getting bored of ISIS and ISIS is losing in the Middle East. I give no credit to Trump for this at all but certainly people will.

People are getting tired of the Russian narrative. I believe Russia did try to push things towards Trump and influence the election but they had to convince the American people to do so through starting discussions. In the end, it was Americans who voted for Trump and he won. A lot of blame on the corruption of the democrats. 

Personally I think Trump is a dumb person with no virtues. Nor is he a man of God. Maybe he's going that route for being in conservative circles nowadays but definitely not the mind to think of those things before, imo. But this doesn't necessarily mean he'll be a bad president. And it's definitely in his best interest to become a good president in the eyes of history. So his actions and policies are an attempt to do so. It would be insincere to say otherwise. 

The left has been really desperate and it doesn't seem like you're trying to learn anything from your losses at all.

[20:24:53] Comment: dyx4hqx by bewilderedshade : That's never more apparent than when you meet the exact (and perhaps surpass) the qualifications/criteria for a job and you are tripped up by what you said. 

For example, many of the great jobs at lets say universities get filled up by people whom the staff know, as they get told of the openings first and are considered first once the interviews come. By law, I believe they have to send notifications out about the job (has to be open to the public), but that's about as far as you get,,or maybe you get an interview that you will not be considered for the job. What is most annoying about it is that these jobs are annoying as hell to apply to (Long applications, ask you for transcripts sometimes even though you haven't even gotten an interview yet etc.). All that work for nothing. 

Now, having said that-always apply anyway. You never know. Maybe the person will get in a car crash and then you get a shot. :(  posted to submission: What are some hard pills to swallow in life?

[20:25:01] Comment: dyx4hr5 by HugeMisfit : Thank you for your thoughtful response.

All four of your listed bad things relate to free will.

- Since disease is caused by environment/intake. Preventing non-"asshole" people from suffering them means limiting what people can do. Sorry, no cookies for you.

- preventing violence is pretty plainly a limit to free will.

- everyone better leave Hawaii. Sorry, I know it's your home/dream vacation, but it's just that pesky active volcano.

- many birth defects are directly resultant from mother's behavior, so, we have to limit that to.

Now, the question is, does a lack of free will create a problem for you or your idea of Utopia?  I mean, if not, then I guess your point stands.  Until someone falls off a ladder.

>If something needs to be grown and cannot be made any other way, then the Abrahamic god is not All-Powerful.

>I'd argue that All-Powerful necessitates that there be no cost and no process. If you can do everything that is doable, but it costs your resources and times, you are not All-Powerful.

Ok. I reject your definition, but I understand your conclusion follows it.  

I think the idea of a "genie" God is a mockery of theists, like a Santa Claus god. Some people believe, theists and atheists alike, that a loving God should Grant us happiness at every request. These are the people that get angry at God and commit sins that bring about suffering.

This is philosophically interesting to me. Deeper than the problem of evil is the question "[if there is a God, ]what is God?". How can we debate the existence of something without defining what we debate? We've drifted into that question.

Finally, do you like the idea of humanity as a simulation?  That one entertains me, as a programmer.  What if God is running a simulation? A genetic algorithm could be used to grow the best souls for a collection of 144000 new bodies God created (with a genie snap!).  Naturally, God would want souls that want to be with God, so that's part of the selection criteria.

Anyway, it's all a bit of philosofun, since we can't actually prove any of it either way. posted to submission: ü§îthis guy might be onto something

As for Arrows, Boomerangs, and Bombs, those are all in BOTW too. I expect them to be visually /mechanically updated to match BOTW. Like how the Melee Bow and Boomerang were updated in Brawl to match the TP design, instead of being completely dropped.

Reality is that I always tend the animals first and they take forever so I didn't even get to Pierre's until after 12.

[20:28:51] Comment: dyx4qs1 by Pat_Sharp : They made tyres with thinner tread to prevent tyre blistering on this high energy track with a new grippy surface. This is something they've done in previous years and isn't that uncommon. Ferrari are unhappy because they feel they'd have suffered less from the blistering, although seeing as every one was still suffering with overheating the tyres and the normal tyres would have been even worse in that regard who knows for sure.

While I'm translating, I'll usually concentrate on information first (word choice, feel of the scene, critical story information, etc), and I always go back either at the end of the day or when I'm finished with a whole section and read it without any regards to the original to make sure it flows well, sounds fine, fix typos etc. Usually during my re-read I'm looking at it with a fresh mind, so I can catch things that were awkwardly worded to make them sound more elegant. posted to submission: I am Jasmine Bernhardt, current translator of S&W and W&P.

[20:31:25] Comment: dyx4usf by indigo_zen : Hm.. I just remember when I shut down shuttles in my game when I was battling the Wildfire. Didn't go well. Had to scrap the colony, because materials didn't get moved fast enough and everything fell apart.

It's not gonna be easy with water. Is it really too far to build like 2 tunnels or something? You just need a depot when the first one ends so the materials for the second will get shuttled over. And than a depot when the water is to build the pump. You also need 2 rovers or hubs, one at the intersection of tunnels and one where the water is. It's not super complicated, but if it's really really far than no go I guess.

If you can, research vaporator tech so you can construct them on your own. Divert cash into research. Than build 4 or 5 and you're ok. posted to submission: What when water runs out?

[20:32:46] Comment: dyx4zvx by parkwayy : While certainly we aren't lighting the world on fire, we aren't nearly as bad as the memes imply.

TSM has been literally a game away every event lately, to advancing, which is the metric by which everyone gauges success apparently.

But honestly the entire community judges success by a bizarre metric. I watch a lot of sports, NHL/NBA/NFL, etc, and no one gives two shits about what round you made it to if you're not in the finals. Just because you made it to a conference finals round by beating some shit team before, doesn't really equate to beans.

[20:32:47] Comment: dyx4zvz by BarkLordTwain : Thank you for your input. 

If we want to nitpick the wording...Overpower means to defeat or overcome with superior force. But from what I've seen when it comes to video games people tend to use it in a way that is open for interpretation depending on the content of their post. (Btw if you couldn't tell from the title everything I said was my opinion. I remain open to the fact that it's not 100% accurate.) Anyway, I see posts on this sub that use the term and are in most cases followed up by something like "I can never win against this character." Or "People only play this character for easy wins." Oh and my personal favorite.. "Remove [Insert character here]" So I honestly believe the term has devolved into something people who have an extremely hard time beating a character throw around after continuously being beaten. and in a majority of the cases I've encountered is mainly because they attempt to use the same tactics on a wide variety of players/characters expecting a different result. Do I think the game is necessarily balanced? No. But do I think there is a character that is so OP that it's beyond a doubt breaking the game? Also no. Where they excel in some areas they fall short in others. They all have strengths as well as weakness that can be exploited. 

As for 70% of the game being frustrating experiences that may be your own personal experience but I don't have any issue when it comes to enjoying this game. In fact I REALLY enjoy the game. If you truly aren't having fun it just might not be the game for you Imo. I'm not all that great at it compared to most but I've never been so put off by losing a match here and there. And when I do it's because I was outplayed. Not because of a characters move set or whatever else people seem to have issues with. On top of all of this I've invested more than enough time into this game to say despite some of its ups and downs I've easily gotten my moneys worth and have had fun. I will continue to play it even longer and enjoy it down the road. If you're so convinced it's as flawed as you say then maybe you're the one who needs to find a new game? I don't know about FIFA. More of an NHL guy myself. But whatever does it for you. 

Now let me explain something that should have been fairly obvious from the start. While I was sharing my personal opinion I was also looking to see what kind of reaction I would get. The last bit of that post should have been a clear indication of this. And you didn't disappoint. You spent a decent amount of time getting frustrated and attempting to insult me (As well worded and entertaining as it was.) And just fell short. Because honestly I just feel bad for you. 

I wish you the best. And once again thank you again for your opinion.  posted to submission: Unpopular opinion...

I'm a single mom so finding any ways to connect with him and make the bond as strong as possible was always my main goal. When he was younger he didn't game too much except for Minecraft. I played more games than he did, but I set him up with a Steam account a few years back and we've had fun playing together. On Spring Break in 2015 we spent every day playing Saints Row 3. The last day of the break we stayed up as long as we could and I was so tempted to let us both take one more day off to just play a little more that night. He's moved on to consoles but I love watching him play sometimes. We still talk about games every day anyway. It's one of my favorite bonding experiences with him üòä posted to submission: Mom is 68 and has been playing Fallout 4 for 3+ years. She's at lvl 132 with 600+ hrs.

[20:33:47] Comment: dyx4zwq by BladeDiavolo : A little late to the party but  while back I got a call from a scammer saying they were with Microsoft and that my computer had been compromised. At the time my laptop's hard drive was dead and had been for a couple of weeks.

I knew it was a scammer and decided to fuck with them a bit but he led me down a much funnier path. 

I asked how he knew and he said they had just got a reading from it a minute ago. When I told them that that was strange because the hard drive has been "shot" for about two weeks he asked if I ment dead or physically shot.... like with a gun....... I opted to say the latter. 

Thus the conversation began as to how it happend, me explaining that my "now ex gf" thought id been unfaithful and shot at me with a pistol only to miss and hit the laptop in the hard drive. 

After asking if I was okay, he proceeded to ask if the issues were because i couldn't satisfy her or if she couldn't satisfy me or what the problem was. And that he would be more than happy to my address and see if he could fix that problem for me..... the call quickly ended from his side and me and my wife just laughed our butts off at the guy. posted to submission: When A Scammer Demands You Authorise the Customer's Payment

They could have similar ones for other Walkers too... Maybe a B/W Liliana with a creature fetch trigger of "if three or more creatures died this turn"...

Hey man, I don't write these moral rules, progress and change does. 

If you want to be hateful and not respect a human who just wants to be happy maybe you should focus on your sets of problems and figure out whats limiting you from being happy and good natured enough to let another person be happy in their life. 

Seems like you have issues. Ill leave you to deal with them.

So these are my SSR characters: https://imgur.com/a/Aoz1Yek

I feel like i'm pretty good on fire, water, light and dark tbh.

The biggest conflict come on the wind and earth side. On wind, my main team is Gawain, Lennah, Scathacha. On Earth, Ayer SR, Dirtlafille, Razia.

I've been thinking about getting either Wind Lancelot or Melissabelle for more consistent wind damage, or upgrading to Ayer (eugh) or daddy vas for earth...

Any suggestions? >_>

Like, if i were to follow strictly the meta pick, it would be Ayer, but at the same time idk, i'd much rather pick anyone else lol, especially for wind which, despite the 7 gun grid i have feels the weakest of them all somehow.

I love my daughter more than anything else but when I was mature enough to realize the bullshit I was into and how unhappy I was, how fucking toxic she was and how much I hated her, I left.

This is not true, the electorate has diverse desires, some of them diametrically opposed.  Also, how might a politician know the will of voters on an individual topic, especially when they seem unanimously opposed to knowing the public's opinion on certain topics?

As someone who lived through the launch of the movie it was a scifi adventure. You can't argue this with me and expect to be right on this in my eyes or the rest of humanity.

[20:38:42] Comment: dyx5ahb by itrhymeswithreally : It looks like you‚Äôre trying to do a few different things all at once. In general, themed decks work best with a main theme and then maybe one sub-theme. Beyond that the themes get too cluttered, making it difficult to capitalize on synergy. As it stands, your deck seems primarily concerned with a mix of merfolk and Druid tribal, with prime speaker being almost an after thought. If that is what you‚Äôre after you would probably be better serve do just making Kumena your general and removing the Prime Speaker game plan. 

If you want to stick with the Speaker, then you should definitely remove all the 2+ mana dorks. Also, the Druid thing feels very shoehorned in. A little light merfolk synergy might be alright. Really I think best strategies with Prime Speaker are fatties (eldrazi), counters (not counterspells), flicker effects, and/or cards that capitalize on card draw (psychosis crawler, chasm skulker).  posted to submission: Need input on Prime Speaker deck
[20:38:43] Comment: dyx5ahe by lartpourlart14 : The listed star players would have betrayed your allegiance, even if you didn't have the banner.

And, clearly, I don't think who "star players" should refer to in this context is determined by novelty as much as it would have to to justify your list.

[20:39:10] Comment: dyx5ai6 by Phytor : Oh man, the Aztec pantheon would for sure make an awesome God of War game! 

There are [A LOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Aztec_gods_and_supernatural_beings) of gods and demigods in the Aztec mythology, and a lot of them were cruel and angry, demanding constant human sacrifice and other things that work great with Kratos' mantra of "There are no good gods." In fact, the Aztecs believed that if they didn't sacrifice humans by cutting out their hearts, the sun would stop moving across the sky and they'd be burned to death! Metal.

It honestly works really perfectly for a God of War game. The Aztec mythology even includes a ceremony every 50 where [the old gods are all killed by the god of volcanoes, fire, and life after death.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Fire_ceremony) The plot basically writes itself! The current cycle of gods is ending, but they're selfish and refuse to honor their duty by sacrificing themselves to keep the world from ending, so Kratos has to sacrifice them the way he does best! 

Their mythology is even laid out like a video game! Their version of hell / the underworld has [9 different levels, with increasingly difficult and deadly challenges including "crossing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field with wind that blew flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome jaguars."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mictlan)

From the book:
"There had been trouble from the early stages of testing. One of the first prototypes had crashed and the pilot had been picked up dead with both his arms missing. In a subsequent crash the body had been found with one arm missing. Eventually it was discovered that the method of baling out had been to blame for these gruesome and extraordinary injuries. In order to jettison the cockpit hood the pilot had had to grip two red levers at the front of the hood itself and exert all his strength to pull them. The hood tore off at once and so great was the pressure on it that he had no time to unclench his fists so that his arms were in danger of being torn from their sockets." posted to submission: Picture I took at the Smithsonian of the Dornier Do 335, a German heavy fighter so fast that even the Hawker Tempest weren't able to catch up with it

Instead of pretending your magic science technologies will give you an unbiased look, recognize your biases. First of all, recognize that you probably lack the awareness to reliably distinguish LARPers, incel tears trolls, and therefore will fall into every trap, believing the wrong things, and writing them down as facts. All of that is hidden bias, and it is difficult to correct, because nothing here is what it seems.

[20:40:56] Comment: dyx5dql by qvickslvr : I just don't think there's a good reason why every pregnancy should be fulfilled if they don't want it to be.

For example, two drug addicted parents get pregnant and really don't want the pregnancy. Should they have to keep it just because it's "life" and inevitably neglect/abuse it? (not saying all would this is just my example) or should they be able to make the active choice to terminate?

Same goes for rape. Why should they have to carry that to term?

I just think it's a slightly archaic view now. People used to have lots of children because there was a high mortality rate. The world isn't like that anymore and I don't see why people shouldn't be able to make that choice for themselves.

Do I think I could ever have one? No, I don't think so, but that doesn't mean others shouldn't have the option or should be shamed for it.

I think everyone is entitled to their opinion on it but I don't think we should pressure others and tell them they're murderers because we don't know their individual circumstances.

Abortions have always been a thing. Its better for the option to be there rather than it going back to how it used to be.  posted to submission: What advice do you have for a 16 year old?

[20:42:09] Comment: dyx5j67 by Commoditism : Yeah don't believe anything, just go with experience and learn from what happens. It takes no believing or faith in anything to do energy work. Try imagining running your hands or a soft brush over your skin as well as something stimulating inside your body, like a pipe cleaner running through your leg. I like to run the sensation from my toes up to my head, almost like I'd be slowly dipping my whole body in some corbanated water that I can feel inside my body as well, doing this repeatedly. I know it sounds weird lol, but if you try it you should start to feel some warm buzzing, energizing feelings throughout your body. I'm fairly certain these are directly related to the vibrations we feel in ap, if not the same thing.

Most experiences I've had, I did this and then went to sleep, and would wake up to something going on.

Robert Bruce has lots of good techniques and advice on this, but he does have a lot of theory about the functionality and belief of chakras, but this is from his own personal experience. 

I've been watching a bunch of Phase Evolution videos on YouTube as I really like his approach and hearing his really interesting experiences, without a lot of fluff and speculation/dogma, very scientific approach. What's interesting is I don't think he does any energy work, which makes me wonder about how different people might have to approach this very differently, some stuff may work for one but not another. Dunno, yeah I'd love to hear what others experiences are. posted to submission: A little help with 'where I am' in my journey...

I did lose a motion for summary judgment last year, three weeks before trial, that I was apoplectic about. Luckily the Court of Appeals fixed it. I shift between feeling like it was a total waste of time and seeing it as a good education on that aspect of the law.

One last thing, I think that lawyers also need to realize the cost-benefit analysis of their work.

[20:43:02] Comment: dyx5j6y by mikedevans247 : Unfortunately, we can only control ourselves.  The nature of any relationship depends on both parties, so it can certainly mean your bond will never improve.  

If it's something you want, there's no harm in trying, though.  If it doesn't work out, you'll know for certain and not have to wonder if things could have been different.  Try to find common ground, no matter how superficial:  TV shows, movies, music, food, kids, spouses, hobbies...anything to anchor a bond other than blood.  

In my own family, I've spoken to my brother a few dozen times by text over the last 5-6 years (we were close enough to get matching tattoos 20 years ago).  I've spoken to my paternal grandmother (my last living grandparent) twice in 18 years.  In contrast, my relationship with my dad has improved quite a bit over the last 10 years, though we'll never be completely in sync.  My mom calls me once or twice a week to talk about the weather and what she's been up to since the last time we spoke.

Ultimately, after you reach adulthood, familial bonds become a choice both members actively decide...like any other relationship. posted to submission: Forgiveness

And fuck our politicians for engraning that gut feeling in me.  For the Uruguayans it's as normal as them as drinking their tea (Yerba Mate), which they do in record amounts as they literally carry it everywhere.

It is normal!  Since I've been here I've noticed cigarette butts everywhere on the ground which will get washed in to the ocean and do way more harm then their policy on cannabis will ever do.

None of the crazy conservative nightmares are realities.  Theres no 11 year olds pulling bongs in the street.  There doesn't seem to be an increase in people that smoke either given it's record cheapness and availability.  It just seems like the same number of people that would use cannabis now do it outside in the parks with friends and street vendors smoke it whilst selling shit.

[20:44:18] Comment: dyx5j7r by RevoDS : I see two advantages:

1)If a bank has a better offer for whatever product, you get to take advantage of the best for each.

2)If for whatever reason one bank's systems go down, you have backup and can still use money from another bank's accounts, either debit or credit.

I would strongly suggest keeping a bank account where you have the LOC though, it's much easier to transfer money to checking and spend it using debit than if you don't have an account. Very few LOCs nowadays have a dedicated card, meaning if you don't have a debit card from that bank you'll need to show up to a teller to withdraw cash from your LOC. posted to submission: Is it beneficial to have a CC, LOC and Bank Account at different banks?

[20:45:58] Comment: dyx5pcv by Thanos-hax : You guys notice how a lot of modern liberal rhetoric revolves around trying to diminish someone's sense of worth or manhood? And they always have some way to pigeon hole you into one of their retarded frameworks. Like if you get mad at anything its cause you're insecure, if you want to be a man, its fragile masculinity, if you don't like progressive politics, you're white privileged, etc.

Liberalism revolves exclusively around foisting a sense of low worth onto people and then banking on them accepting it. The simplest response is to not give a shit. Liberalism has a buy in requirement: these weaklings have no real power so they prescribe rules and frameworks ideologically and derive their power from people's willing participation. Like how a tiny woman can control a powerful horse. The horse is letting her, she has no real power over it other than the psychological conditioning that caused the horse to comply.

So, what I'm getting at here is that liberalism is espoused by the weakest people because they can't get their way by other means. Just ignore them completely and embrace ideas like the patriarchy or whatever else they find threatening. Once people shake off this idea that we're bound to progressive ideals, we can be free of their constant pestering. posted to submission: Men feel more relaxed having friends men?

[20:46:02] Comment: dyx5pcz by Sarkat : Well, to start out, there are 2 ways to play him: cannons and army.

Cannons are pretty self-explanatory. You need to focus on mineral income FAST, and add 3rd and 4th gas only after fully saturating both bases on minerals - you will only use gas on several energizers, upgrades, and several monoliths in key points. You can expand to monoliths a bit later, when stronger waves come. Basically you need to put clusters of photon cannons with a row of batteries in the front (batteries are cheaper to replace and hinder melee enemies like zerglings and zealots who are targeting the photon cannons behind the batteries) and an energizer in the back. For upgrades you want the first two tiers SoA energy regeneration and stun on your SoA ability, all the cannon upgrades (start with range and attack speed) and energy regeneration for your energizers - the rest are optional. This playstyle is better suited for defensive maps like Dead of Night, Temple of the Past and Oblivion Express, and can be used on the Part and Parcel - highly aggressive maps are not that good with this approach.

Second option is going Army. You NEED the full discount on units mastery (which brings the Karax unit cost within 5% of the standard cost, almost negligible difference). The first half of the game you will spend on building up your tech tree and making upgrades while clearing the objectives with a squad of 14-20 zealots + 1-2 energizers. Zealot ressurection upgrade is mandatory, and needs to be ordered by the first Chrono Wave, and attack/defense upgrades are also highly sought after. SoA energy regeneration is even more important here, as SoA will be your only way of dealing with air units in the build up phase - don't waste it on ground units apart from glass cannons like siege tanks or high templars; SoA also allows you to ignore detection in the first phase. Karax zealots are very sturdy, both having the passive regeneration via SoA and ressurection from the upgrade, and their mediocre offensive power is offset by energizer boosts. You can also use energizers' active ability to add zealots on the field, so keep them at all costs. If you have some free gas, feel free to throw a couple of energizers on follow for your mate's army, he will really appreciate that.

After you've fully saturated both of your bases and built up the tech tree, time for high hitters. I usually prefer to go mass immortals (with the exception of the two zombie maps, where you need mass collossi): dedicate 2-4 building to churning out immortals (as your gas income allows), while finishing upgrades and throwing several collosi in the mix for long-range anti-swarm support. Immortal ability is a must, as you will use it to snipe air units, which will be far more numerous in the second half of the game. Basically, 12-14 immortals with a steady stream of zealots can deal with most land armies, and the immortal ability is very good at both sniping huge hybrids and dealing with pesky battlecruisers. Don't forget to add a couple of observers against banshees and swarm hosts, though you don't really need them - you can always snipe those with your SoA - they help and are not that expensive. Placing a couple of extra Nexus (Nexii?) for a sole purpose of additional chrono boosting of your buildings is a good idea. Dump extra minerals on photon cannons for both you and your mate.

Another route is going carriers, pretty straightforward. The caveat is that you will need a separate set of upgrades for the Carriers, and they are VERY slow: start with zealots, only put +2/+2 for ground forces, and start working on air upgrades. Carrier upgrade (repair bots) is an unneeded luxury, you already have passive repairs, so can skip it. Four stargates is more than enough, you will be starving gas anyway. Carriers will be better against heavy air composition, and slower against heavy mech or swarms. posted to submission: How does one play Karax?

[20:46:18] Comment: dyx5pd9 by Xiaolt : SSDs come with different connection ports, if your laptop has a 2.5 inch sata 3Gbps or 6Gbps port HDD you can buy and SSD with the same ports. Usually Samsung Evos 2.5 inch SSD will work (or any 2.5 inch sata 3or6 Gbps will do).

OS migration is a really painful process a fresh format is always recommended when you migrate from HDD to SSD. This is for a cleaner system which is integrated with the SSD completely. Migration of OS by copying from HDD to SSD is only recommended if you have a lot of programs installed and if it consumes a lot of your time for a fresh install. But trust me, on an SSD, a fresh install of windows 10 pro takes less than 5 minutes. As a tool sometimes I use EaseUS Todo Backup to migrate OS from HDD to SSD since you asked.

[20:48:14] Comment: dyx5tud by Tzelanit : Currently yes but shortly probably not.

The [Big FAQ](https://whc-cdn.games-workshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/warhammer_40000_The_Big_FAQ_1_2018_en.pdf) introduced a beta alteration to the Battle Brothers rule witch prevents the Imperium keyword, among others, from being used as the Detachment keyword. While it's not strictly necessary to conform to the beta rules, they show what the design team is currently thinking about the development of the game, and will likely be added to some extent as full rules somewhere down the line.

Even though you can do it now, it's not the greatest idea, as it prevents the AM units in the Detachment from using Regimental Doctrines, and if it's your only Detachment, it's not an AM Detachment, so you don't unlock the AM Stratagems and stuff. posted to submission: Some quick questions, new to 8th edition

[20:48:19] Comment: dyx5tuh by thisdude415 : Paris is good to use Hyatt points or book through UR portal. 

It is one of the most expensive cities in the world for hotels, especially in the city center. And Paris is probably the number one city for reward travel in the world. Average nice hotel is $200-350 per night, 7 nights is $1400 to $2450. That‚Äôs ~100-200k UR or 300-500k Hilton points. That‚Äôs a *lot* of churning. 

Consider an AirBnB, a smaller hotel chain, or a boutique hotel. There are decent places for <10k UR per night in the city center.  posted to submission: Summer Travel to Paris

[20:49:41] Comment: dyx5xuc by DaintyBites : I will convert based on the back of my ingredients and give you a summary of how I got that number in grams in case you want to convert ingredients yourself in the future. You may want to remember that sometimes what is technically 1 cup of flour in grams (120g) may not be exactly what the creator of the recipe used. This is especially true since they didn't measure their ingredients. So there is a chance that they packed too much flour into a cup and it may have been over 120g when they made the recipe. But, it should turn out okay with exact measurements too! 

120g Flour (1/4 cup = 30G so 1 cup = 120g)

192g Granulated Sugar (1tsp = 4g. 48 tsp in 1 cup: 48tsp x 4g = 192g)

3.6g Baking Powder (1/8 tsp = 0.6g. There are six 1/8 tsp in 3/4 tsp so 0.6g x 6 = 3.6g) I would round up to just barely 4g.

3.6g Baking Soda (1/8 tsp = 0.6g. There are six 1/8 tsp in 3/4 tsp so 0.6g x 6 = 3.6g) Round up to just 4g.

40g Cocoa Powder (1 tbsp = 5g. 8 tbsp in 1/2 cup: 8 tbsp x 5g = 40g)

1 large egg (A large egg is about 50-55g here)

120g whole milk (I measure in grams, 1/2 cup equals 120ml which is the same as its weight in grams)

56g vegetable oil (1 tbsp = 14g. 4 tbsp in 1/4 cup: 4 tbsp x 14g = 56g)

I can't really measure vanilla because there is no nutrition label. : ( I usually just do a cap full or a splash for each tsp in the recipe. 

Good luck with the recipe and I hope it comes out tasty!  posted to submission: How to convert cups/tsp/tbs to grams

Thats perfectly fine if your goal is to significantly reduce the risk of serious injury. Dont get any dog that looks like a pitbull.

[20:49:48] Comment: dyx5xui by TheChewyDaniels : A few thoughts/observations:

1. He is engaged to a black woman. I‚Äôd be curious to hear her perspective on the past and current failure of Reddit to ban openly white supremacist, misogynistic, pedophilic, and violent subreddits?

2. While I agree that Reddit has failed terribly at removing hate-filled subreddits I do not think Reddit (as a site or resource) is completely evil and has never contributed anything good to the world like the author of the article really seems to imply. This subreddit for example wouldn‚Äôt exist or be so popular if that were true.

3. IMO Reddit (the site as a whole not individual subreddits) doesn‚Äôt do a great job of advertising/encouraging/explaining to users how to document and report disturbing/hateful content. If it is true that the reason these hate subreddits weren‚Äôt reported enough was do to the low user reports numbers then it might be simply because a lot of people don‚Äôt know what to do when they come across something hateful on Reddit or they just downvote it and assume (wrongfully) that the site will find it eventually and delete it. I don‚Äôt think it is the case that the majority of Reddit users are hateful psychopaths silently endorsing racism by failing to report hateful content like the author seems to insinuate. I think it‚Äôs more of a lack of awareness about what to do, how to do it, and a naive faith that somewhere at Reddit there is someone at a desk who looks for this type of content and will have it removed by tomorrow. posted to submission: Throwback to when one of Redditxs founders was outraged over white nationalists marching on his alma mater, but not upset over white nationalists on his website

TFL should have powers to limit the number of private hire vehicles operating in London. I mean it's great and all that I can get a ride within mere minutes pretty much anywhere in Zone 3, but the cost of that is that at any moment, there are a ton of drivers cruising around hoping to pick up a fare.

[20:51:06] Comment: dyx5xve by 7supersonicfan : I think you misunderstand what I meant by Quick Ending. The Quick Ending requires you to delete Monika's character file *before starting a new game.* After this, Sayori instantly becomes club president, starts going crazy, and forces a game shutdown. When this happens, all .chr files are deleted. Boot up the game, and you see an end screen, followed by a black and white Sayori hanging, with static sound. In this case, it was 100% Sayori deleting everyone else after going insane. posted to submission: Monika Is Not Inherently Evil, The Club President Is.

[20:51:38] Comment: dyx5xvt by JordanLeDoux : It's even more crazy than most people think. I have a friend who is an engineer for advanced research at Intel's Ronler Acres facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. That's basically where Intel figures out how to actually make the things that they sell. Virtually every chip that Intel sells is made at Ronler Acres first, because it's where they design the manufacturing process for each chip. Once that process is finalized, it's replicated out to Intel's other facilities.

In order to layer the materials that they need to on a chip, they use materials that can be removed with ultraviolet light (oversimplification, but good enough for this). However, for a while now they've been working with transistors that are *smaller than the wavelength of light that they use to actually create the structures*.

Normally this would be pretty much impossible, except that at Ronler Acres they figure out how to design *interference patterns* for the lights that etch the correct shapes.

All that bullshit about light being not a wave and not a particle that you thought was just useless physics stuff? You know the one where almost every student is like "yeah, but where would I actually use this"?

Making your fucking computer, that's where. :P 

It was absolutely mind boggling when he showed me around that facility. They have clean rooms there that are bigger in floor space than some car assembly factories that are over a million times cleaner than a surgical room. Because that's what's necessary to manufacture the things that go into making computer parts on the scale our society demands.

And Ronler Acres has somewhat *small* manufacturing facilities, because they aren't the ones that pump out the ones that go on the shelf, they are mainly designing and testing the manufacturing process at a smaller scale.

Behind the buildings with clean rooms they have 10 story tall liquid helium tanks. They have their own water distilling plant on site because that's the only way to get water pure enough for what they need. They have a "recondenser" building that forcefully condenses water out of the air and is like a giant tower where it is constantly raining inside of it all day.

The things that go into creating our modern society are truly hard to comprehend. posted to submission: The Deadliest Being on Planet Earth ‚Äì The Bacteriophage

[20:54:01] Comment: dyx66xr by BBB_1024 : If we are going off realistic gun mechanics the British L1 and L7's should have near 440mm of pen. The M103, Foch, and AMX 50 120 would implode any tank the round would enter and near 360mm of pen. Plus the Germans would be screwed in this department unless you were in a leopard PTA or the lights cause most of their tanks rely on their armor and are too fat and slow to do anything against guns so powerful that armor was considered useless until the invention of composite armor. posted to submission: A question about Gun Handling.

[20:54:07] Comment: dyx66xu by tboland1 : I am in agreement about the drive probably being toast - or at least not trustworthy enough to ever use as a boot drive.

Think about complete replacement if this is your daily driver. If it's a secondary machine, then think about getting a cheap SSD in the 60 to 128GB range. 

As far as Windows license is concerned, see if the laptop has a sticker on it with the Windows Key on it. Probably not. I am assuming the documentation and disks that may have come with the machine have been lost to the ages.

If you want to see if you can get any information off of that drive, you will need a USB to SATA adapter for the suspect drive in order to get any information off of it. Or you can put it into a desktop computer than has some open SATA slots and power.

Das ist eigentlich auch genau der Effekt eines Notfalltopfs. Der Betrag ist relativ best√§ndig, da man ihn im Falle eines Notfalls schnellstm√∂glich wiederauff√ºllt. Falls man √ºberhaupt jemals einen Notfall hat. Also ist es ein nahezu gleich bleibender Betrag, den man grundlos nicht investiert.

Deswegen investiere ich alles (und verwende Kreditkarten f√ºr Liquidit√§t) und das hat bis jetzt schon einen gigantischen Unterschied gemacht. Da verkaufe ich auch gerne mit Verlust in der n√§chsten Krise.

I feel like every shooter since even the Halo days have been trying to get that movie feel where we remember it forever. I'm sure a lot of you can quote Halo off the top of your head.

[20:56:24] Comment: dyx6av5 by Ziddletwix : > Best of 1 has been the biggest adjustment to me. Too many games seem to come down to mana flood/screw. My first Dominaria draft deck was b/g saprolings including 2 eviscerate and 3 vicious offering. I proceeded to go 1-3 due to flood/screw. DO NOT keep remotely sketchy hands.

Regarding mulligans, this is one of those things where it *feels* one way, but the reality is that bo1 vs bo3 shouldn't change how risky your mulligan is. The logic of "well you have a game to give" just doesn't hold up. In each case, each choice gives you a percentage chance to win, and you should always take the higher chance. The fact that in one case you have a bo3 doesn't mean there is any actual benefit to taking riskier or safer strategy.

To be clear, that's not to say there aren't good reasons to take a riskier or safer mulligain strategy! If you're playing an unfavored matchup in constructed, you absolutely may want to understand that you need to target a particularly great hand to have a chance to win, and mulligan more aggressively. But specifically in the context where all else is equal, but the only difference is the switch from bo3 to bo1, the math is crystal clear. There should be no idfferene in your mulligan. If mulliganing is correct in a bo1, then it is also correct in a bo3, simple as that. There are no other concerns but the question "which gives me a better chance to win this game", which is identical in both scenarios.

[20:56:45] Comment: dyx6avk by dontjudgemoi420 : I mean, if his forward dodge bash is still so good, I dont see why i would go into the alternate or uppercut when i could just forward bash again. 

It's not like the other bashes give any greater reward when hitting, aside from bash alternate, which gives a top heavy on wallsplat. In all other scenarios, both of them only confirm a light, (keep in mind uppercut's weirdly high stamina cost). And both only confirm a light, and there's more risk attached to both bashes, then why would i use them? In the case of forward bash, it is not only difficult to deal with for even top level players, you can also bait out a dodge with an empty dodge gb for an even greater punish.

Also, you said making them both available, but what would the input be? 

I'm all for making conq less shield bash spammy, but i dont think your suggestions provide much incentive to not-exclusively use forward bash. posted to submission: Making Conqs Bashes Distinct

[20:56:49] Comment: dyx6avr by oratory1990 : > I mean they have a profile on them on the sonarworks app. I'm guessing its gonna be the same end result?

Here's the thing: Not every DT770 sounds identical. And that's true for **all** headphones.  
Not every HD600 sounds identical, not every K701 sounds identical.  
The reason for this is what in the industry is known as "tolerances". Small deviations from target values. The wire for the voice coil might be slighty thinner at some points, or a tad shorter. The glue on the diaphragm might be slightly heavier or lighter, the foam for the earpads could be slightly stiffer.  
All of that results in the fact that while all DT770s are very similar, they may differ by 1 or 2 dB over the whole frequency range.  
  
Now, the regular profile on the Sonarworks app is created by measuring an average of 10 headphones of that model.  
But if you want the calibration to be even more accurate, you can buy your headphone directly from Sonarworks, because then they will give you a calibration profile specificaly tailored for this exact headphone. Not the model but your exact specimen.  
  
> Are they comfortable wearing for longer periods of time? How about the low end?  
  
They're okay. My ears stand off a bit from the head and they touch the drivers which is uncomfortable after a few hours but it's not too bad.  
  
Low End is fine on the DT770 - and it gets a lot better with the calibration. Not *more* low end, but more accurate low end. posted to submission: Opinions on Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro 80/250 Ohm?

Before I did the surrogacy, I was living paycheck to paycheck and barely scraping by. I certainly couldn't afford to go back to school. After I finished grad school, I quickly got a job in my new field making twice as much. I moved to a new city for work, far away, and met someone there.

I hope that you can have some relief from your anxiety. Keep praying about it. The Bible is full of encouragement about anxiety and worry. And I hope you have someone to talk to about it. If it‚Äôs very bad and constant, then you might want to find a therapist.

I highly encourage you to talk to your pastor about this, or another mature Christian. They should be able to help you long-term with these things, and point you to more resources that can help. posted to submission: Ive had a few dreams about the end times and they are nightmares.

[20:58:55] Comment: dyx6fqa by dexter311 : A bitter loss, we had a few chances in the last 5 minutes which could have really given us a shot.  Benny's last two set shots were uncharacteristically disappointing.

Jacobs really showing what a dedicated tagger can achieve... just a shame we didn't have one for Cotchin too.  Keeping Dusty out of the match for three quarters, forcing him to start up forward, that's a huge win for him.  Cunners is a fucking beast, but his ball use was a bit down on average IMO.  Great efforts up back too from JMac, McDonald and Majak, solid from Taz and Thommo, but especially in the first half we were a bit too tall down back.  Bringing Majak up forward a bit more was a good move from Scotty.

Jacobs 5

Cunnington 4

Macmillan 3

Anderson 2

McDonald 1

Could have raffled off the last vote to any of Majak, Higgins, Atley or Thompson I reckon.  All were pretty solid. posted to submission: Post Match/Votes Thread: North Melbourne v Richmond
